<p><em>André Theuriet, born at Marly-le-Roi in
1833, went to Paris to study law, and finally
became head of the Government Department
of Finance. In 1857 appeared the charming
collection of verses called "Chemin des Bois,"
which was crowned by the Academy, and
which earned for the author the title of "Song
Sparrow" from the great critic Sainte-Beuve.</em></p>

<p><i>Theuriet received, in 1890, the Vitel prize
from the Academy for general literary excellence,
and was admitted to that body in 1896.
His style is sane, fresh, limpid, delicate, and
rich in color. He is a lover of nature with a
profound feeling for the peasant.</i></p>

<p><em>Theuriet's standing is well assured when
we consider that such men as Jules Claretie,
Adolph Brisson, François Coppée, all contributed
appreciations of Theuriet in "Les Annales
Politiques et Littéraires," soon after his death,
on April 23, 1907.</em></p>

</div>

<p class="center p1 big1">BY ANDRÉ THEURIET</p>



<p class="center p2b">Translated by B. C. Waggener.<br> Copyright, 1891, by The Current Literature
Publishing Company.</p>


<p>One November evening, the eve of Sainte-Catherine's
Day, the gate of the Auberive
prison turned upon its hinges to allow to pass
out a woman of some thirty years, clad in a faded
woolen gown and coiffed in a linen cap that framed
in a singular fashion a face pale and puffed by that
sickly-hued fat which develops on prison regimen.
She was a prisoner whom they had just liberated, and
whom her companions of detention called La Bretonne.</p>

<p>Condemned for infanticide, it was exactly, day for
day, six years ago that the prison van had brought her
to the Centrale. Now, in her former garb, and with
her small stock of money received from the clerk in
her pocket, she found herself free and with her roadpass
stamped for Langres.</p>

<p>The courier for Langres, however, had long since
gone. Cowed and awkward, she took her way stumblingly
toward the chief inn of the borough, and with
trembling voice asked shelter for the night. But the
inn was crowded, and the <em>aubergiste</em>, who did not care
to harbor "one of those birds from over yonder,"
counseled her to push on to the <em>cabaret</em> at the far end
of the village.</p>

<p>La Bretonne passed on, and, more trembling and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1340">[Pg 1340]</span>awkward than ever, knocked at the door of that
cabaret, which, properly speaking, was but a cantine
for laborers. The cabaretière also eyed her askance,
scenting doubtless a "discharged" from the Centrale,
and finally refused her on the plea that she had no bed
to give her.</p>

<p>La Bretonne dared not insist, but with bowed head
pursued her way, while at the bottom of her soul rose
and grew a dull hatred for that world which thus
repulsed her.</p>

<p>She had no other resource than to gain Langres
afoot.</p>

<p>Toward the end of November, night comes quickly.
Soon she found herself enveloped in darkness, on a
grayish road that ran between two divisions of the
forest, and where the north wind whistled fiercely,
choked her with dust, and pelted her with dead leaves.</p>

<p>After six years of sedentary and recluse life her
legs were stiff, the muscles knotted and her feet, accustomed
to sabots, pinched and bruised by her new slippers.
At the end of a league she felt them blistered
and herself exhausted. She dropped upon a pile of
stones by the wayside, shivering and asking herself if
she was going to be forced to perish of cold and
hunger in this black night, under this icy breeze, which
froze her to the marrow.</p>

<p>All at once, in the solitude of the road, she seemed
to hear the droning notes of a voice singing. She listened
and distinguished the air of one of those caressing
and monotonous chants with which one soothes
young children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1341">[Pg 1341]</span></p>

<p>She was not alone, then!</p>

<p>She struggled to her feet and in the direction from
which the voice came, and there, at the turn of a crossroad,
perceived a reddish light streaming through the
branches. Five minutes later she was before a mud-walled
hovel, whose roof, covered by squares of sod,
leaned again the rock, and whose window had allowed
to pass that beckoning ray.</p>

<p>With anxious heart she decided to knock.</p>

<p>The chant ceased instantly and a woman opened the
door, a peasant woman, no older than La Bretonne
herself, but faded and aged by work. Her bodice,
torn in places, displayed the skin tanned and dirty;
her red hair escaped disheveled from under a soiled
stuff cap, and her gray eyes regarded with amazement
the stranger whose face had in it something of touching
loneliness.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" said she, lifting yet higher the
sputtering lamp in her hand; "what do you desire?"</p>

<p>"I am unable to go on," murmured La Bretonne, in
a voice broken by a sob; "the city is far, and if you
will lodge me for the night, you will do me a service....
I have money; I will pay you for the trouble."</p>

<p>"Enter," replied the other, after a moment's hesitancy;
"but why," continued she, in a tone more curious
than suspicious, "did you not sleep at Auberive?"</p>

<p>"They would not give me a lodging," lowering her
blue eyes and taken with a sudden scruple, "be—because,
see you, I come from the Maison Centrale."</p>

<p>"So! the Maison Centrale! but no matter—enter—I
fear nothing, having known only misery. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1342">[Pg 1342]</span>
I've a conscience against turning a Christian
from the door on a night like this. I'll give you a bed
and a slice of cheese."</p>

<p>And she pulled from the eaves some bundles of
dried heather and spread them as a pallet in the corner
by the fire.</p>

<p>"Do you live here alone?" demanded La Bretonne,
timidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, with my <em>gâchette</em>, going on seven years now.
I earn our living by working in the wood."</p>

<p>"Your man, then, is dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other bruskly, "the <em>gâchette</em> has no
father. Briefly, to each his sorrow! But come, behold
your straw, and two or three potatoes left from supper.
It is all I can offer you—"</p>

<p>She was called by a childish voice coming from
a dark nook, separated from the room by a board
partition.</p>

<p>"Good night!" she repeated, "the little one cries; I
must go, but sleep you well!"</p>

<p>And taking up the lamp she passed into the closet,
leaving La Bretonne crouched alone in the darkness.</p>

<p>Stretched upon her heather, after she had eaten her
supper, she strove to close her eyes, but sleep would
not come to her. Through the thin partition she heard
the mother still softly talking to the child, whom the
arrival of a stranger had wakened, and who did not
wish to go to sleep again.</p>

<p>The mother soothed and fondled it with words of
endearment that somehow strangely disturbed La
Bretonne. That outburst of simple tenderness seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1343">[Pg 1343]</span>
to waken a confused maternal instinct in the soul of
that girl condemned in the past for having stifled her
new-born.</p>

<p>"If things had not gone so badly with me," thought
La Bretonne, sorrowfully, "<em>it</em> would have been the
same age as this little one here."</p>

<p>At that thought and at the sound of that childish
voice, a sickening shudder seemed to shake her very
vitals; something soft and tender to spring up in that
soured heart, and an increasing need for the relief
of tears.</p>

<p>"But come, come, my little one," the mother cried,
"to sleep you must go! And if you are good and do
as I say, to-morrow I'll take you to the Sainte-Catherine's
Fair!"</p>

<p>"The <em>fête</em> of little children, mama; the <em>fête</em> of little
children, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my angel, of little children."</p>

<p>"And the day when the good Sainte-Catherine
brings playthings to the babies, mama?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes—yes."</p>

<p>"Then why doesn't she bring playthings to our
house, mama?"</p>

<p>"We live too far away, perhaps; and then—we are
too poor."</p>

<p>"She brings them only to rich babies, then, mama?
But why, mama, why, I say? I should love to see
playthings!"</p>

<p>"Eh, bien! some day you may, if you are very good—to-night,
perhaps, if you are wise and go to sleep
soon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1344">[Pg 1344]</span></p>

<p>"I will, then, mama, I will right away, so she can
bring them to-morrow."</p>

<p>The little voice ceased; there was a long silence;
then a long breath, even and light!</p>

<p>The child slept at last—the mother also.</p>

<p>La Bretonne, only, did not sleep! An emotion, at
once poignant and tender, tore at her heart, and she
thought more than ever of that other little one, whom
they said she had killed.... This lasted till dawn.</p>

<p>Mother and child slept still, but La Bretonne was up
and out, gliding hurriedly and furtively in the direction
of Auberive and slackening her pace only when
the first houses of the village came in sight.</p>

<p>Soon she had reached and was traversing its only
street, walking slowly now and scanning with all her
eyes the signs of the shops. One at last seemed to fix
her attention. She knocked at the shutter and presently
it opened. A mercer's shop, apparently, but also
with some toys and playthings in the window—poor,
pitiful trifles, a pasteboard doll, a Noah's ark, a woolly,
stiff-legged little sheep!</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the merchant, La Bretonne
purchased them all, paid, and went out. She had resumed
the road to the hovel in the wood, when suddenly
a hand fell heavily upon her shoulder, and she
was face to face with a brigadier of <em>gendarmerie</em>.</p>

<p>The unhappy one had forgotten that it was forbidden
to liberated prisoners to loiter near the Maison
Centrale.</p>

<p>"Instead of vagabondizing here, you should already
be at Langres," said the brigadier, gruffly. "Come,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1345">[Pg 1345]</span>
march, be off with you! To the road, to the road,
I say!"</p>

<p>She sought to explain. Pains lost. At once a passing
cart was pressed into service, La Bretonne bundled
into it, and in charge of a <em>gendarme</em> once more en
route for Langres.</p>

<p>The cart jolted lumberingly over the frozen
ruts. The poor La Bretonne clutched with a heartbroken
air her bundle of playthings in her freezing
fingers.</p>

<p>All at once, at a turn of the road, she recognized
the cross path that led through the wood. Her heart
leaped and she besought the <em>gendarme</em> to stop only
one moment. She had a commission for La Fleuriotte,
the woman that lived there!</p>

<p>She supplicated with so much fervor that the <em>gendarme</em>,
a good man at heart, allowed himself to be
persuaded. They stopped, tied the horse to a tree, and
ascended the pathway.</p>

<p>Before the door La Fleuriotte hewed the gathered
wood into the required fagots. On seeing her visitor
return, accompanied by a <em>gendarme</em>, she stood open-mouthed
and with arms hanging.</p>

<p>"Hist!" said La Bretonne, "hist! the little one—does
it sleep still?"</p>

<p>"Yes—but—"</p>

<p>"Then, here, these playthings, lay them on the bed
and tell her Sainte-Catherine brought them. I returned
to Auberive for them; but it seems I had no
right to do it, and they are taking me now to
Langres."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1346">[Pg 1346]</span></p>

<p>"Holy Mother of God!" cried the amazed La Fleuriotte.</p>

<p>"Hist! be still, I say!"</p>

<p>And drawing near the bed herself, followed always
by her escort, La Bretonne scattered upon the coverlet
the doll, the Noah's ark, and the stiff-legged, woolly,
and somewhat grimy little lamb, bent the bare arm of
the child till it clasped the latter, then turned with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Now," said she, addressing the <em>gendarme</em>, vigorously
rubbing his eyes with the cuff of his jacket—the
frost, it seemed, had gotten into them—"I am ready:
we can go!"</p>

<p><em>Edmond About, born at Dieuze in 1828, author
of a play, "Gaetana," the noisy failure of
which crushed for a long time his dramatic
aspiration, turned to the writing of novels,
such as "The Marriages of Paris," "Madelon,"
and "The Romish Question," the latter a book
which attacked with great venom and vivacity
the temporal power of the Pope. "The Man of
the Old School" is a general title under which
he collected separate stories, studies of social
reform, such as "The Romance of an Honest
Man," at one time an eloquent manual of patriotism.
About has also written studies in
politics and finance, besides art criticisms,
more brilliant than profound.</em></p>

<p><em>About's style is distinguished by its spirit
and lucidity. He knows how to tell a story,
and has great respect for his mother tongue.
He was elected to the Academy in 1884, but
died in 1885 without delivering his thesis.</em></p>

<h3>I</h3>


<p>One might pass Dr. Auvray's house twenty
times without suspecting the miracles that
are wrought there. It is a modest establishment
near the end of Montaigne Avenue, between
Prince Soltikoff's Gothic palace and the gymnasium.
The unpretentious iron gates open into a small garden,
filled with lilacs and rosebushes. The porter's
lodge is on the left side of the gateway; the wing
containing the doctor's office and the apartments of
his wife and daughter are on the right; while the main
building stands with its back to the street and its south
windows overlook a small grove of horsechestnuts and
lindens.</p>

<p>It is there that the doctor treats, and generally cures,
cases of mental aberration. I would not introduce you
into his house, however, if you incurred any risk of
meeting frenzied lunatics or hopeless imbeciles. You
will be spared all such harrowing sights. Dr. Auvray
is a specialist, and treats cases of monomania only.
He is an extremely kind-hearted man, endowed with
plenty of shrewdness and good sense; a true philosopher,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1350">[Pg 1350]</span>
an untiring student, and an enthusiastic follower
of the famous Esquirol.</p>

<p>Having come into possession of a small fortune
soon after the completion of his medical course, he
married, and founded the establishment which we have
described. Had there been a spark of charlatanism in
his composition, he could easily have amassed a fortune,
but he had been content to merely earn a living.
He shunned notoriety, and when he effected a wonderful
cure, he never proclaimed it upon the housetops.
His very enviable reputation had been acquired without
any effort on his part, and almost against his will.
Would you have a proof of this? Well, his treatise on
monomania, published by Baillière in 1852, has passed
through six editions, though the author has never sent
a single copy to the newspapers. Modesty is a good
thing, certainly, but one may carry it too far. Mademoiselle
Auvray will have a dowry of only twenty
thousand francs, and she will be twenty-two in April.</p>

<p>About a month ago a hired coupé stopped in front
of Dr. Auvray's door, from which two men alighted
and entered the office. The servant asked them to be
seated, and await his master's return.</p>

<p>One of the visitors was about fifty years of age, a
tall, stout, dark-complexioned but ruddy-faced man,
rather ungainly in figure and appearance. He had
thick, stubby hands and enormous thumbs. Picture a
laboring man, dressed in his employer's clothes, and
you have M. Morlot.</p>

<p>His nephew, Francis Thomas, is a young man, about
twenty-three years old; but it is very difficult to describe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1351">[Pg 1351]</span>
him, as there is nothing distinctive either in his
manner or appearance. He is neither tall nor short,
handsome nor ugly, stout nor thin—in short, he is
commonplace and mediocre in every respect, with chestnut
hair, and of an extremely retiring disposition, manner
and attire. When he entered Dr. Auvray's office,
he seemed to be greatly excited. He walked wildly to
and fro, as if unable to remain in one place; looked
at twenty different things in the same instant, and
would certainly have handled them all if his hands had
not been tied.</p>

<p>"Compose yourself, my dear Francis," said his
uncle, soothingly. "What I am doing is for your
own good. You will be perfectly comfortable and
happy here, and the doctor is sure to cure you."</p>

<p>"I am not sick. There is nothing whatever
the matter with me. Why have you tied my
hands?"</p>

<p>"Because you would have thrown me out of the
window, if I had not. You are not in your right mind,
my poor boy, but Dr. Auvray will soon make you well
again."</p>

<p>"I am as sane as you are, uncle; and I can't imagine
what you mean. My mind is perfectly clear and my
memory excellent. Shall I recite some poetry to you,
or construe some Latin? I see there is a Tacitus here
in the bookcase. Or, if you prefer, I will solve a problem
in algebra or geometry. You don't desire it?
Very well, then listen while I tell you what you have
been doing this morning.</p>

<p>"You came to my room at eight o'clock, not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1352">[Pg 1352]</span>
wake me, for I was not asleep, but to get me out of
bed. I dressed myself without any assistance from
Germain. You asked me to accompany you to Dr.
Auvray's; I refused; you insisted; then Germain aided
you in tying my hands. I shall dismiss him this evening.
I owe him thirteen days' wages; that is to say,
thirteen francs, as I promised to pay him thirty francs
a month. You, too, owe him something, as you are
the cause of his losing his New Year's gift. Isn't this
a tolerably clear statement of the facts? Do you still
intend to try to make me out a lunatic? Ah, my dear
uncle, let your better nature assert itself. Remember
that my mother was your sister. What would my
poor mother say if she saw me here? I bear you no
ill-will, and everything can be amicably arranged.
You have a daughter."</p>

<p>"Ah, there it is again. You must certainly see that
you are not in your right mind. I have a daughter—I?
Why, I am a bachelor, as you know perfectly
well."</p>

<p>"You have a daughter—" repeated Francis,
mechanically.</p>

<p>"My poor nephew, listen to me a moment. Have
you a cousin?"</p>

<p>"A cousin? No, I have no cousin. Oh, you won't
catch me there. I have no cousin, either male or
female."</p>

<p>"But I am your uncle, am I not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you are my uncle, of course, though you
seem to have forgotten the fact this morning."</p>

<p>"Then if I had a daughter, she would be your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1353">[Pg 1353]</span>
cousin; but as you have no cousin, I can have no
daughter."</p>

<p>"You are right, of course. I had the pleasure of
meeting her at Ems last summer with her mother;
I love her; I have reason to believe that she is not
indifferent to me, and I have the honor to ask you
for her hand in marriage."</p>

<p>"Whose hand, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Your daughter's hand."</p>

<p>"Just hear him," Morlot said to himself. "Dr.
Auvray must certainly be very clever if he succeeds
in curing him. I am willing to pay him six thousand
francs a year for board and treatment. Six thousand
francs from thirty thousand leaves twenty-four thousand.
How rich I shall be! Poor Francis!"</p>

<p>He seated himself again, and picked up a book that
chanced to be lying on a table near him.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," he said soothingly, "and I will
read you something. Try to listen. It may quiet
you."</p>

<p>Opening the volume, he read as follows:</p>

<p>"'Monomania is opinionativeness on one subject;
a persistent clinging to one idea; the supreme ascendency
of a single passion. It has its origin in the heart.
To cure the malady, the cause must be ascertained
and removed. It arises generally from love, fear,
vanity, overweening ambition or remorse, and betrays
itself by the same symptoms as any other passion;
sometimes by boisterousness, gaiety, and garrulousness;
sometimes by extreme timidity, melancholy, and
silence.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1354">[Pg 1354]</span></p>

<p>As M. Morlot read on, Francis became more quiet,
and at last appeared to fall into a peaceful slumber.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" thought the uncle, "here is a triumph of
medical skill already. It has put to sleep a man who
was neither hungry nor sleepy!"</p>

<p>Francis was not asleep, but he was feigning sleep
to perfection. His head drooped lower and lower,
and he regulated his heavy breathing with mathematical
exactness. Uncle Morlot was completely deceived.
He went on reading for some time in more
and more subdued tones; then he yawned; then he
stopped reading; then he let the book drop from his
hands and closed his eyes, and in another minute he
was sound asleep, to the intense delight of his nephew,
who was watching him maliciously out of the corner
of his eye.</p>

<p>Francis began operations by scraping his chair on
the uncarpeted floor, but M. Morlot moved no more
than a post. Francis then tramped noisily up and
down the room, but his uncle snored the louder. Then
the nephew approached the doctor's desk, picked up
an eraser that was lying there, and with it finally succeeded
in cutting the rope that bound his hands. On
regaining his liberty he uttered a smothered exclamation
of joy; then he cautiously approached his uncle.
In two minutes, M. Morlot himself was securely
bound, but it had been done so gently and so adroitly
that his slumbers had not been disturbed in the least.</p>

<p>Francis stood admiring his work for a moment;
then he stooped and picked up the book that had fallen
to the floor. It was Dr. Auvray's treatise on monomania.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1355">[Pg 1355]</span>
He carried it off into a corner of the room
and began to read it with much apparent interest, while
awaiting the doctor's coming.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It is necessary to revert briefly to the antecedents
of this uncle and nephew. Francis Thomas was the
only son of a former toy-merchant, on the Rue de
Saumon. The toy trade is an excellent business, about
one hundred per cent profit being realized on most
of the articles; consequently, since his father's death,
Francis had been enjoying that ease generally known
as honest ease; possibly because it enables one to live
without stooping to sordid acts; possibly, too, because
it enables one to keep one's friends honest, also. In
short, he had an income of thirty thousand francs
a year.</p>

<p>His tastes were extremely simple, as I have said
before. He detested show, and always selected gloves,
waistcoats, and trousers of those sober hues shading
from dark brown to black. He never carried an eyeglass
for the very good reason, he said, that he had
excellent eyesight; he wore no scarf-pin, because he
needed no pin to hold his cravat securely; but the
fact is, he was afraid of exciting comment. He would
have been wretched had his sponsors bestowed upon
him any save the most commonplace names; but,
fortunately, his cognomens were as modest and unpretending
as if he had chosen them himself.</p>

<p>His excessive modesty prevented him from adopting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1356">[Pg 1356]</span>
a profession. When he left college, he considered
long and carefully the seven or eight different paths
open before him. A legal career seemed to be attended
with too much publicity; the medical profession
was too exciting; business too complicated. The responsibilities
of an instructor of youth were too onerous;
the duties of a government official too confining
and servile. As for the army, that was out of the
question, not because he feared the enemy, but because
he shuddered at the thought of wearing a uniform;
so he finally decided to live on his income, not because
it was the easiest thing to do, but because it was the
most unobtrusive.</p>

<p>But it was in the presence of the fair sex that his
weakness became most apparent. He was always in
love with somebody. Whenever he attended a play or
a concert he immediately began to gaze around him in
search of a pretty face. If he found one to his taste,
the play was admirable, the music perfection; if he
failed, the whole performance was detestable, the
actors murdered their lines, and all the singers sang
out of tune. He worshiped these divinities in secret,
however, for he never dared to speak to one of them.</p>

<p>When he fancied himself a victim to the tender passion,
he spent the greater part of his time in composing
the most impassioned declarations of love, which
never passed his lips, however. In imagination he
addressed the tenderest words of affection to his
adored one, and revealed the innermost depths of his
soul to her; he held long conversations with her, delightful
interviews, in which he furnished both the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1357">[Pg 1357]</span>
questions and answers. His burning protestations of
undying love would have melted a heart of ice, but
none of his divinities were ever aware of his aspirations
and longings.</p>

<p>It chanced, however, in the month of August of
that same year, about four months before he so
adroitly bound his uncle's hands, that Francis had
met at Ems a young lady almost as shy and retiring
as himself, a young lady whose excessive timidity
seemed to imbue him with some of the courage of an
ordinary mortal. She was a frail, delicate <em>Parisienne</em>—pale
as a flower that had blossomed in the shade,
and with a skin as transparent as an infant's. She
was at Ems in company with her mother, who had
been advised to try the waters for an obstinate throat
trouble, chronic laryngitis, if I remember right. The
mother and daughter had evidently led a very secluded
life, for they watched the noisy crowd with undisguised
curiosity and amazement. Francis was introduced
to them quite unexpectedly by one of his friends
who was returning from Italy by way of Germany.
After that, Francis was with them almost constantly
for a month; in fact, he was their sole companion.</p>

<p>For sensitive, retiring souls, a crowd is the most
complete of solitudes; the more people there are around
them, the more persistently they retreat to a corner to
commune with themselves. Of course, the mother and
daughter soon became well acquainted with Francis,
and they grew very fond of him. Like the navigator
who first set foot on American soil, they discovered
some new treasure every day. They never inquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1358">[Pg 1358]</span>
whether he was rich or poor; it was enough for them
to know that he was good. Francis, for his part, was
inexpressibly delighted with his own transformation.
Have you ever heard how spring comes in the gardens
of Russia? One day everything is shrouded in snow;
the next day a ray of sunshine appears and puts grim
winter to flight. By noon the trees are in bloom; by
night they are covered with leaves; a day or two more
and the fruit appears.</p>

<p>The heart of Francis underwent a similar metamorphosis.
His reserve and apparent coldness disappeared
as if by magic, and in a few short weeks the
timid youth was transformed into a resolute, energetic
man—at least to all appearances. I do not know which
of the three persons first mentioned marriage, but that
is a matter of no consequence. Marriage is always
understood when two honest hearts avow their love.</p>

<p>Now Francis was of age, and undisputed master of
himself and his possessions, but the girl he loved had a
father whose consent must be obtained, and it was just
here that this young man's natural timidity of disposition
reasserted itself. True, Claire had said to him:
"You can write to my father without any misgivings.
He knows all about our attachment. You will receive
his consent by return mail."</p>

<p>Francis wrote and rewrote his letter a hundred
times, but he could not summon up the courage to
send it.</p>

<p>Surely the ordeal was an easy one, and it would
seem as though the most timorous mind could have
passed through it triumphantly. Francis knew the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1359">[Pg 1359]</span>
name, position, fortune, and even the disposition of his
prospective father-in-law. He had been initiated into
all the family secrets, he was virtually a member of
the household. The only thing he had to do was to
state in the briefest manner who he was and what he
possessed. There was no doubt whatever as to the
response; but he delayed so long that at the end of a
month Claire and her mother very naturally began to
doubt his sincerity. I think they would have waited
patiently another fortnight, however, but the father
would not permit it. If Claire loved the young man,
and her lover was not disposed to make known his
intentions, the girl must leave him at once. Perhaps
Mr. Francis Thomas would then come and ask her
hand in marriage. He knew where to find her.</p>

<p>Thus it chanced that, one morning when Francis
went to invite the ladies to walk as usual, the proprietor
of the hotel informed him that they had returned to
Paris, and that their apartments were already occupied
by an English family. This crushing blow, falling so
unexpectedly, destroyed the poor fellow's reason, and,
rushing out of the house like a madman, he began a
frantic search for Claire in all the places where he had
been in the habit of meeting her. At last he returned
to his own hotel with a violent sick headache, which
he proceeded to doctor in the most energetic manner.
First he had himself bled, then he took baths in boiling
hot water, and applied the most ferocious mustard
plasters; in short, he avenged his mental tortures upon
his innocent body. When he believed himself cured,
he started for France, firmly resolved to have an interview<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1360">[Pg 1360]</span>
with Claire's father before even changing his
clothes. He traveled with all possible speed, jumped
off the train before it stopped, forgetting his baggage
entirely, sprang into a cab, and shouted to the
coachman:</p>

<p>"Drive to her home as quick as you can!"</p>

<p>"Where, sir?"</p>

<p>"To the house of Monsieur—on the—the Rue—I
can't remember." He had forgotten the name and
address of the girl he loved.</p>

<p>"I will go home," he said to himself, "and it will
come back to me."</p>

<p>So he handed his card to the coachman, who took
him to his own home.</p>

<p>His concierge was an aged man, with no children,
and named Emmanuel. On seeing him, Francis bowed
profoundly, and said:</p>

<p>"Sir, you have a daughter, Mlle. Claire Emmanuel.
I intended to write and ask you for her hand in marriage,
but decided it would be more seemly to make
the request in person."</p>

<p>They saw that he was mad, and his uncle Morlot,
in the Faubourg Saint Antoine, was immediately
summoned.</p>

<p>Now Uncle Morlot was the most scrupulously honest
man on the Rue Charonne, which, by the way, is
one of the longest streets in Paris. He manufactured
antique furniture with conscientious care, but only
mediocre skill. He was not a man to pass off ebonized
pine for real ebony, or a cabinet of his own make
for a medieval production; and yet, he understood the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1361">[Pg 1361]</span>
art of making new wood look old and full of apparent
worm-holes as well as anybody living; but it was a
principle of his never to cheat or deceive any one.
With almost absurd moderation for a follower of this
trade, he limited his profits to five per cent over and
above the expenses of the business, so he had gained
more esteem than money. When he made out a bill,
he invariably added up the items three times, so afraid
was he of making a mistake in his own favor.</p>

<p>After thirty years of close attention to business he
was very little better off than when he finished his
apprenticeship. He had merely earned his living, just
like the humblest of his workmen, and he often asked
himself rather enviously how his brother-in-law had
managed to acquire a competence. If this brother-in-law,
with the natural arrogance of a <em>parvenu</em>, rather
looked down on the poor cabinet-maker, the latter,
with all the pride of a man who has not tried to succeed
financially, esteemed himself all the more highly.
He gloried in his poverty, as it were; and said to
himself with plebeian pride: "I, at least, have the
satisfaction of knowing that I owe nothing to any
one."</p>

<p>Man is a strange animal: I am not the first person
who has made that remark. This most estimable
M. Morlot, whose overscrupulous probity made him
almost a laughing-stock, experienced a singular feeling
of elation in his secret heart when he was apprised
of his nephew's condition. An insinuating voice
whispered softly: "If Francis is insane, you will become
his guardian."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1362">[Pg 1362]</span></p>

<p>"You will be none the richer," responded Conscience,
promptly.</p>

<p>"And why not?" persisted the Tempter. "The expenses
of an insane person never amount to thirty
thousand francs a year. Besides, you will be put to
a great deal of trouble and have to neglect your business,
very probably, so it is only right that you should
receive some compensation. You will not be wronging
any one by taking part of the money."</p>

<p>"But one ought to expect no compensation for such
services to a member of one's family," retorted the
voice of Conscience.</p>

<p>"Then why have the members of our family never
done anything for me? I have been in straitened circumstances
again and again, and have found it almost
impossible to meet my obligations, but neither my
nephew Francis nor his deceased father ever rendered
me the slightest assistance."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," replied his better nature; "this attack
of insanity is nothing serious. Francis will be himself
again in a few days."</p>

<p>"It is just as probable that the malady will wear him
out and that you will come into possession of the entire
property," persisted the wily Tempter.</p>

<p>The worthy cabinet-maker tried to close his ears to
the insidious voice, but his ears were so large that the
subtle, persistent voice glided in, despite all his efforts.
The establishment on the Rue Charonne was intrusted
to the care of the foreman, and the uncle took up his
abode in his nephew's comfortable apartments. He
slept in an excellent bed, and enjoyed it very much; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1363">[Pg 1363]</span>
sat down to a well-spread table, and the indigestion,
which had tormented him for years, vanished as if by
enchantment. He was waited upon and shaved by
Germain, his nephew's valet, and he speedily came to
regard such attentions as a necessity. Gradually, too,
he became accustomed to seeing his nephew in this
deplorable condition, and to quite reconcile himself to
the idea that he would never be cured, but all the while
he kept repeating to himself, as if to ease his conscience,
"I am wronging nobody."</p>

<p>At the expiration of three months he had become
very tired of having an insane person shut up in the
house with him—for he had long since begun to consider
himself at home—and his nephew's incessant
maundering, and continual requests for Mlle. Claire's
hand in marriage, became an intolerable bore. He
therefore resolved to get rid of him by placing him
in Dr. Auvray's insane asylum.</p>

<p>"After all, my nephew will be much better cared for
there," he said to himself, "and I shall be much easier
in mind. Every one admits that the best way to divert
a lunatic's mind is to give him a change of scene, so
I am only doing my duty."</p>

<p>It was with this very thought in his mind that he
fell asleep just before Francis bound his hands. What
an awakening was his!</p>

<p>The doctor entered with a smiling excuse for his
long delay. Francis rose, laid his book on the table,
and proceeded with volubility to explain the business
that had brought him there.</p>

<p>"It is my uncle on my mother's side that I desire to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1364">[Pg 1364]</span>
intrust to your care," he began. "He is, as you see,
a man between forty-five and fifty years of age, accustomed
to manual labor and the economy and privations
of a humble and busy life; moreover, he was
born of healthy, hard-working parents, in a family
where no case of mental aberration was ever before
known. You will not, therefore, be obliged to contend
with a hereditary malady. His is probably one of the
most peculiar cases of monomania that has ever come
under your observation. His mood changes almost
instantaneously from one of extreme gaiety to profound
melancholy. In fact, it is a strange compound
of monomania and melancholy."</p>

<p>"He has not lost his reason entirely?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; he is never violent; in fact, he is insane
upon one subject only."</p>

<p>"What is the nature of his malady?"</p>

<p>"Alas! the besetting sin of the age, sir; cupidity.
He has become deeply imbued with the spirit of our
times. After working hard from childhood, he finds
himself still comparatively poor, while my father, who
began life under like circumstances, was able to leave
me a snug little fortune. My uncle began by being
envious of me; then the thought occurred to him that,
being my only relative, he would become my heir in
case of my death, and my guardian in case I became
insane; and as it is very easy for a weak-minded person
to believe whatever he desires to believe, the
unfortunate man soon persuaded himself that I had
lost my reason. He has told everybody that this is the
case; and he will soon tell you so. In the carriage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1365">[Pg 1365]</span>
though his hands were tied, he really believed that it
was he who was bringing me here."</p>

<p>"When did this malady first show itself?"</p>

<p>"About three months ago. He came to my concierge
and said to him, in the wildest manner: 'Monsieur
Emmanuel, you have a daughter. Let me in, and then
come and assist me in binding my nephew.'"</p>

<p>"Is he aware of his condition? Does he know that
his mind is affected?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, and I think that is a favorable sign. I
should add, however, that his physical health is somewhat
impaired, and he is much troubled with indigestion
and insomnia."</p>

<p>"So much the better; an insane person who sleeps
and eats regularly is generally incurable. Suppose
you allow me to wake him."</p>

<p>Dr. Auvray placed his hand gently on the shoulder
of the sleeper, who instantly sprang to his feet. The
first movement he made was to rub his eyes. When he
discovered that his hands were tied, he instantly suspected
what had taken place while he was asleep, and
burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"A good joke, a very good joke!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Francis drew the doctor a little aside.</p>

<p>"Sir, in five minutes he will be in a towering rage,"
he whispered.</p>

<p>"Let me manage him. I know how to take him."</p>

<p>The good doctor smiled on the supposed patient as
one smiles on a child one wishes to amuse. "Well,
you wake in very good spirits, my friend; did you
have a pleasant dream?" he asked affably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1366">[Pg 1366]</span></p>

<p>"No, I had no dream at all; I'm merely laughing
to find myself tied up like a bundle of fagots. One
would suppose that I was the madman, instead of my
nephew."</p>

<p>"There, I told you so," whispered Francis.</p>

<p>"Have the goodness to untie my hands, doctor. I
can explain better when I am free."</p>

<p>"I will unbind you, my friend, but you must promise
to give no trouble."</p>

<p>"Can it be, doctor, that you really take me for an
insane person?"</p>

<p>"No, my friend, but you are ill, and we will take
care of you, and, I hope, cure you. See, your hands
are free; don't abuse your liberty."</p>

<p>"What the devil do you imagine I'll do? I came
here merely to bring my nephew."</p>

<p>"Very well, we will talk about that matter by and
by. I found you sound asleep. Do you often fall
asleep in the daytime?"</p>

<p>"Never! It was that stupid book that—"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! This is a serious case," muttered the
author of the book referred to. "So you really believe
that your nephew is insane?"</p>

<p>"Dangerously so, doctor. The fact that I was
obliged to bind his hands with this very rope is proof
of that."</p>

<p>"But it was your hands that were bound. Don't
you recollect that I just untied them?"</p>

<p>"But let me explain—"</p>

<p>"Gently, gently, my friend, you are becoming excited.
Your face is very red; I don't want you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1367">[Pg 1367]</span>
fatigue yourself. Just be content to answer my questions.
You say that your nephew is ill?"</p>

<p>"Mad, mad, mad, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"And it pleases you to see him mad?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Answer me frankly. You don't wish him to be
cured, do you?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me that?"</p>

<p>"Because his fortune is under your control. Don't
you wish to be rich? Are you not disappointed and
discouraged because you have toiled so long without
making a fortune? Don't you very naturally think
that your turn has come now?"</p>

<p>M. Morlot made no reply. His eyes were riveted
on the floor. He asked himself if he was not dreaming,
and tried his best to decide how much of this
whole affair was real, and how much imaginary, so
completely bewildered was he by the questions of this
stranger, who read his heart as if it had been an open
book.</p>

<p>"Do you ever hear voices?" inquired Dr. Auvray.</p>

<p>Poor M. Morlot felt his hair stand on end, and remembering
that relentless voice that was ever whispering
in his ear, he replied mechanically, "Sometimes."</p>

<p>"Ah, he is the victim of an hallucination," murmured
the doctor.</p>

<p>"No, there is nothing whatever the matter with me,
I tell you. Let me get out of here. I shall be as
crazy as my nephew if I remain much longer. Ask
my friends. They will all tell you that I am perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1368">[Pg 1368]</span>
sane. Feel my pulse. You can see that I have no
fever."</p>

<p>"Poor uncle!" murmured Francis. "He doesn't
know that insanity is delirium unattended with fever."</p>

<p>"Yes," added the doctor, "if we could only give
our patients a fever, we could cure every one of
them."</p>

<p>M. Morlot sank back despairingly in his armchair.
His nephew began to pace the floor.</p>

<p>"I am deeply grieved at my uncle's deplorable condition,"
he remarked feelingly, "but it is a great consolation
to me to be able to intrust him to the care of a
man like yourself. I have read your admirable treatise
on monomania. It is the most valuable work of
the kind that has appeared since the publication of the
great Esquirol's Treatise upon Mental Diseases. I
know, moreover, that you are truly a father to your
patients, so I will not insult you by commending M.
Morlot to your special care. As for the compensation
you are to receive, I leave that entirely to you."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he drew from his pocket-book a thousand-franc
note and laid it on the mantel. "I shall do
myself the honor to call again some time during the
ensuing week. At what hour are your patients allowed
to see visitors?"</p>

<p>"From twelve to two, only; but I am always at
home. Good day, sir."</p>

<p>"Stop him! stop him!" shouted Uncle Morlot.
"Don't let him go. He is the one that is mad; I will
tell you all about it."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my dear uncle," said Francis, starting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1369">[Pg 1369]</span>
toward the door. "I leave you in Dr. Auvray's
care; he will soon cure you, I trust."</p>

<p>M. Morlot sprang up to intercept his nephew, but
the doctor detained him.</p>

<p>"What a strange fatality!" cried the poor uncle.
"He has not uttered a single senseless remark. If he
would only rave as usual, you would soon see that I
am not the one who is mad, but—"</p>

<p>Francis already had his hand on the door-knob, but
turning suddenly, he retraced his steps as if he had
forgotten something and, walking straight up to the
doctor, said:</p>

<p>"My uncle's malady was not the only thing that
brought me here."</p>

<p>"Ah," murmured M. Morlot, seeing a ray of hope,
at last.</p>

<p>"You have a daughter," continued the young man.</p>

<p>"At last!" shouted the poor uncle. "You are a
witness to the fact that he said: 'You have a
daughter.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the doctor, addressing Francis. "Will
you kindly explain—"</p>

<p>"You have a daughter, Mlle. Claire Auvray."</p>

<p>"There, there! didn't I tell you so?" cried the uncle.</p>

<p>"Yes," again replied the doctor.</p>

<p>"She was at Ems three months ago with her
mother."</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo!" yelled M. Morlot.</p>

<p>"Yes," responded the physician for the third time.</p>

<p>M. Morlot rushed up to the doctor, and cried: "You
are not the doctor, but a patient in the house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1370">[Pg 1370]</span></p>

<p>"My friend, if you are not more quiet we shall have
to give you a douche."</p>

<p>M. Morlot recoiled in terror. His nephew continued
calmly:</p>

<p>"I love your daughter, sir; I have some hope that
I am loved in return, and if her feelings have not
changed since the month of September, I have the
honor to ask her hand in marriage."</p>

<p>"Is it to Monsieur Francis Thomas that I have the
honor of speaking?" inquired the doctor.</p>

<p>"The same, sir. I should have begun by telling you
my name."</p>

<p>"Then you must permit me to say, sir, that you have
been guilty of no unseemly haste—"</p>

<p>But just then the good doctor's attention was diverted
by M. Morlot, who was rubbing his hands in a
frenzied manner.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, my friend?" the
doctor asked in his kind, fatherly way.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing! I am only washing my hands.
There is something on them that troubles me."</p>

<p>"Show me what it is. I don't see anything."</p>

<p>"Can't you see it? There, there, between my fingers.
I see it plainly enough."</p>

<p>"What do you see?"</p>

<p>"My nephew's money. Take it away, doctor. I'm
an honest man; I don't want anything that belongs to
anybody else."</p>

<p>While the physician was listening attentively to M.
Morlot's first ravings, an extraordinary change took
place in Francis. He became as pale as death, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1371">[Pg 1371]</span>
seemed to be suffering terribly from cold, for his teeth
chattered so violently that Dr. Auvray turned and
asked what was the matter with him.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he replied. "She is coming, I hear her!
It is joy, but it overpowers me. It seems to be falling
on me and burying me beneath its weight like a snowdrift.
Winter will be a dreary time for lovers. Oh,
doctor, see what is the matter with my head!"</p>

<p>But his uncle rushed up to him, crying:</p>

<p>"Enough, enough! Don't rave so! I don't want
people to think you mad. They will say I stole your
reason from you. I'm an honest man. Doctor, look
at my hands, examine my pockets, send to my house
on the Rue Charonne. Search the cupboard. Open
all the drawers. You will find I have nothing that
belongs to any other person."</p>

<p>Between his two patients the doctor was at his wits'
end, when a door opened, and Claire came in to tell
her father that breakfast was on the table.</p>

<p>Francis leaped up out of his chair, as if moved by
a spring, but though his will prompted him to rush
toward Mlle. Auvray, his flesh proved weak, and he
fell back in his chair like lead. He could scarcely
murmur the words:</p>

<p>"Claire, it is I! I love you. Will you—"</p>

<p>He passed his hand over his forehead. His pale face
became a vivid scarlet. His temples throbbed almost
to bursting; it seemed to him that an iron band was
contracting more and more around his head, just above
his brows. Claire, frightened nearly to death, seized
both his hands; his skin was so dry, and his pulse so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1372">[Pg 1372]</span>
rapid that the poor girl was terrified. It was not thus
that she had hoped to see him again. In a few minutes,
a yellowish tinge appeared about his nostrils;
nausea ensued, and Dr. Auvray recognized all the
symptoms of a bilious fever.</p>

<p>"How unfortunate!" he said to himself. "If this
fever had only attacked his uncle, it would have cured
him!"</p>

<p>He rang. A servant appeared, and shortly afterward
Mme. Auvray, who scarcely knew Francis, so
greatly had he changed. It was necessary that the
sick man should be got to bed without delay, and
Claire relinquished her own pretty room to him.
While they were installing him there, his uncle wandered
excitedly about the parlor, tormenting the doctor
with questions, embracing the sick man, seizing Mme.
Auvray's hand and exclaiming wildly: "Save him,
save him! He shall not die! I will not have him
die! I forbid it. I have a right to. I am his uncle
and guardian. If you do not care for him, people will
say I killed him. You are witnesses to the fact that
I ask for none of his property! I shall give all his
possessions to the poor! Some water—please give me
some water to wash my hands!" He was taken to the
building occupied by the patients, where he became so
violent that it was necessary to put him in a strait-jacket.</p>

<p>Mme. Auvray and her daughter nursed Francis with
the tenderest care. Confined in the sick-room day and
night, the mother and daughter spent most of their
leisure time discussing the situation. They could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1373">[Pg 1373]</span>
explain the lover's long silence or his sudden reappearance.
If he loved Claire, why had he left her in
suspense for three dreary months? Why did he feel
obliged to give his uncle's malady as an excuse for presenting
himself at Dr. Auvray's house? But if he had
recovered from his infatuation, why did he not take
his uncle to some other physician? There were plenty
of them in Paris. Possibly he had believed himself
cured of his folly until the sight of Claire undeceived
him? But no, he had asked her father for her hand in
marriage before he saw her again. But, in his delirium,
Francis answered all or nearly all of these
questions. Claire, bending tenderly over him, listened
breathlessly to his every word, and afterward repeated
them to her mother and to the doctor, who was not
long in discovering the truth. They soon knew that
he had lost his reason and under what circumstances;
they even learned how he had been the innocent cause
of his uncle's insanity. Fears of an entirely different
nature now began to assail Mlle. Auvray. Was the
terrible crisis which she had unwittingly brought about
likely to cure his mental disorder? The doctor assured
his daughter that a fever, under such circumstances,
was almost certain to put an end to the insanity, but
there is no rule without its exception, especially in
medicine. And even if he seemed to be cured, was
there not danger of a recurrence of the malady?</p>

<p>"So far as I am concerned, I am not in the least
afraid," said Claire, smiling sadly. "I am the cause
of all his troubles. Therefore, it is my duty to console
him. After all, his madness consists merely in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1374">[Pg 1374]</span>
continually asking my hand. There will be no need of
doing that after I become his wife, so we really have
nothing to fear. The poor fellow lost his reason
through his excessive love; so cure him, my dear
father, but not entirely. Let him remain insane enough
to love me as much as I love him!"</p>

<p>"We will see," replied Dr. Auvray. "Wait until
this fever passes off. If he seems ashamed of having
been demented, if he appears gloomy, or melancholy
after his recovery, I can not vouch for him; if, on the
contrary, he remembers his temporary aberration of
mind without mortification or regret—if he speaks of
it without any reserve, and if he is not averse to seeing
the persons who nursed him through his illness, there
is not the slightest reason to apprehend a return of the
malady."</p>

<p>On the 25th of December, Francis, fortified by a cup
of chicken broth and half the yolk of a soft boiled
egg, sat up in bed, and without the slightest hesitancy
or mortification, and in a perfectly lucid manner,
gave the history of the past three months without any
emotion save that of quiet joy. Claire and Mme.
Auvray wept as they listened to him; the doctor pretended
to be taking notes, or rather to be writing under
dictation, but something besides ink fell on the paper.
When the story ended, the convalescent added, by way
of conclusion:</p>

<p>"And now on this, the 25th day of December, I
say to my good doctor, and much loved father—Dr.
Auvray, whose street and number I shall never again
forget—'Sir, you have a daughter, Mlle. Claire Auvray,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1375">[Pg 1375]</span>
whom I met at Ems, with her mother. I love
her; she has proved that she loves me in return, and
if you have no fears that I will become insane again,
I have the honor to ask her hand in marriage."</p>

<p>The doctor was so deeply affected that he could only
bow his head in token of assent, but Claire put her
arms around the sick man's neck and kissed him tenderly
on the forehead. I am sure I should desire no
better response under like circumstances.</p>

<p>That same day, M. Morlot, who had become much
more quiet and tractable, and who had long since been
released from the bondage of a strait jacket, rose about
eight o'clock in the morning, as usual. On getting out
of bed, he picked up his slippers, examined and reexamined
them inside and out, then handed them to a
nurse for inspection, begging him to see for himself
that they contained no thirty thousand francs. Until
positively assured of this fact he would not consent
to put them on. Then he carefully shook each of his
garments out of the window, but not until after he had
searched every fold and pocket in them. After his
toilet was completed, he called for a pencil, and wrote
on the walls of his chamber:</p>

<p>"<em>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's money, nor
anything that is his.</em>"</p>

<p>Dr. Auvray is confident of his ability to cure him,
but it will take time. It is in the summer and autumn
that physicians are most successful in their endeavors
to cure insanity.</p>

<p><em>Ludovic Halévy was born at Paris in 1834,
and began to write for the theatre when very
young. He is the author of the opera librettos,
"Orphée aux Enfers," 1861, "Carmen," 1875,
etc.; besides a number of vaudevilles, such as
"Froufrou," etc. Most of his pieces are written
in collaboration with Meilhac. Outside of the
theatre he has published a collection of little
scenes in the paper called "La Vie Parisienne,"
under the title of "Madame Cardinal" and "Les
Petits Cardinal"; impressions of war under the
title "L'Invasion," and some novels, such as
"L'Abbé Constantin," 1882. In 1884 he was
elected a member of the Academy.</em></p>

<p><em>Halévy tempered the fantastic humors of
Meilhac, and restrained the more far-fetched of
his own, bringing them down to earth. His
theatre paints what is called Parisian life, remarkable
for ease, delicacy, grace, but without
much substance. His novels have a very delicate
flavor, with a combination of suavity and
irony.</em></p>

Publishing Company.</p>


<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;">
<em>Nov. 25th, 1893. 4 o'clock.</em></p>

<p>This morning at ten o'clock I was just settling
down to attack Beethoven's Twenty-fifth
symphony, when the door opened, and who
should walk in but mama. Mama awake and stirring
at ten o'clock! And not only awake and stirring, but
dressed and ready to go out—mantled and bonneted.</p>

<p>I could not remember ever to have seen her stirring
so early before. She never manages to get to church
on Sunday before the middle of the one o'clock mass.
The other evening she said, laughingly, to Abbé
Pontal:</p>

<p>"Monsieur l'Abbé, our dear religion would be absolutely
perfect if you substituted a mass at two for
that at one. Then the concerts at the <em>Conservatoire</em>
could be put an hour later, and Sunday in winter would
be all that could be desired."</p>

<p>At mama's entrance I was stupefied, and exclaimed:
"You are going out, mama?"</p>

<p>"No, I've just come in."</p>

<p>"You've just come in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I had something to do this morning—to
choose some stuffs for the hangings—that blue, you
know, which is so difficult to find."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1380">[Pg 1380]</span></p>
<p>"Have you found it?"</p>

<p>"No—no. But that they say they can get it for me—and
I hope that—They are going to send it by the
day after to-morrow at the latest."</p>

<p>Mama got quite confused in her explanation. She
finally announced that we were going to a <em>soirée</em> at the
Mercerey's. There was to be a little music. She had
known of it for several days, but had forgotten to
mention it to me before. I didn't show the slightest
sign of surprise, but while listening to mama, I
studied her carefully, and thought to myself: "What's
the meaning of all this? Mama rambling about at
this unearthly hour, matching blues! A <em>soirée musicale</em>
at the Mercerey's! Mama evidently confused,
too! There's something hidden."</p>

<p>So I let her flounder and never uttered a sound.
When she had finished she took a few steps toward
the door, just as actors do in a theatre when they pretend
they are going out, then she turned back and tried
to say with an air of indifference, as if the thought had
only just occurred to her: "Which gown do you think
of putting on to-night?"</p>

<p>"To-night, mama? Really, I don't know. I might
put the gray on—or the blue—or the rose."</p>

<p>"No, no; not the rose. Put the blue on. You
looked quite nice in it the day before yesterday at
Aunt Clarice's. Besides, your papa doesn't like the
rose, and as he is going with us to the Mercerey's—"</p>

<p>"Papa going to the Mercerey's!"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly."</p>

<p>"Does he know that there's to be some music?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1381">[Pg 1381]</span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He knows—and yet he is going?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What is there surprising in that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, mama; nothing at all."</p>

<p>Whereupon she really left the room, and I was quite
alone. Then, without a moment's hesitation, I said to
myself: "A marriage on the <em>tapis</em>. They're going to
show me off to some one. <em>That's</em> why pap is obliged
to go."</p>

<p>Fancy papa letting himself be dragged by mama to
a <em>soirée musicale</em>! The whole world will seem topsy-turvy.
There are only three places which he finds
bearable in the evening—the club, the opera during
the ballet, and the little theatres where people go to
laugh and amuse themselves generally—the theatres
where young girls are not allowed to go, but where I
intend to go when I am married.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm sure there's an interview in the wind. It
must be something of great importance, for mama has
been in a state of the highest excitement ever since this
morning. She ate no breakfast, and didn't manage to
conceal her unrest at all. Not only has she inspected
my blue dress carefully, but she has also examined me
with equal thoroughness. She fell into a fit of veritable
despair on verifying the fact that there was a slight
flaw on my features.</p>

<p>"What's that?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Where? What? mama!"</p>

<p>"On the tip of your nose."</p>

<p>"Have I anything on the tip of my nose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a horrid gash."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1382">[Pg 1382]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, good gracious! A gash?"</p>

<p>Quite horrified, I rushed to the mirror. Then I
breathed freely again. It was the merest trifle—where
the kitten had given me a pat with its paw.
Nothing worth mentioning—a little reddish mark that
was hardly visible to the naked eye, and which could
easily be got rid of before evening.</p>

<p>But in mama's solicitous eyes the little mark assumed
the proportions of a disfiguring wound. The tip of
my nose has never received so much touching attention
before. Mama made me sit still in an armchair
during half of the day, with cold-water cloths fixed
like a pair of goggles on the said tip of the aforementioned
nose.</p>

<p>Poor mama! She's so anxious to see me married.
It's quite natural, after all. She looks very well herself
yet in the evening, and it is awkward to have
to drag a big marriageable daughter around at her
heels.</p>

<p>I don't like it, either, for that matter. I know that
I make her look older, and, therefore, as soon as we
enter a room in the evening I slip away from her, and
try to see as little as possible of her afterward until the
carriage is announced. So each goes her own way,
and interferes as little as possible with the other.</p>

<p>She's a dear, good old soul. There are mothers
who simply bully their daughters, and worry them into
marrying at five minutes' notice. Quite a leap in the
dark. Mama isn't one of them.</p>

<p>Besides, she knows I have made up my mind not to
be hurried—and not to decide carelessly. Marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1383">[Pg 1383]</span>
is not a trifling thing. If a mistake is made it is for
life; so it's well to know what one is doing when one
takes the plunge. When I get married it will be in all
seriousness. I don't intend to tumble head over ears
in love with the first newcomer, be he fair or dark,
who says to his mother: "I've found the girl of my
choice. I love her, and her alone. I'll have her or
nobody."</p>

<p>Oh, no! I'm not going into that stupidity. I intend
to keep my eyes open, and my wits about me.</p>

<p>Last spring I declined five very likely wooers simply
because none of them offered all the advantages of
birth, fortune, and position which I consider I am
justified in demanding.</p>

<p>I shall follow the same course of action during the
winter campaign—the same calm prudence. I am not
yet twenty, so I can afford to wait.</p>

<p>Since this morning I have felt highly satisfied with
myself—<em>very</em> highly satisfied. I have not been in the
least affected by mother's open agitation. To-day, as
usual, I have glanced through my notes.</p>

<p>On my eighteenth birthday I find I wrote the following
simple words on the first page of my notebook,
which I still keep carefully under lock and key:</p>


<h3>MY MARRIAGE.</h3>


<p>"And so five have bitten the dust already." I'm
sure there'll be a sixth combatant in the lists to-night.
Is he the one who will finally become my very humble
and very obedient servant and lord?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1384">[Pg 1384]</span></p>

<p>In any case, he had better get ready to undergo the
most rigorous and searching examination.</p>

<p>I'm not like mama. I don't lose <em>my</em> head.</p>


<p class="right p1" style="padding-right: 2em;">
<em>Nov. 26th. Four o'clock.</em><br>
</p>

<p>I wasn't mistaken. It <em>was</em> the sixth.</p>

<p>But let me be orderly, and write the events, both
small and great, in their due sequence.</p>

<p>After dinner mama and I went upstairs to dress. I
took a long time over it, and was very careful, too. I
may as well tell the truth. I worked at my toilet. It
took me an hour and a half to dress to my own complete
satisfaction. On coming downstairs I found all
the doors open, and as I noiselessly approached the
drawing-room I heard papa and mama talking. Papa
said:</p>

<p>"You think it <em>absolutely</em> necessary, then?"</p>

<p>"<em>Absolutely</em> necessary. Just think of it. Your presence
is indispensable."</p>

<p>The temptation was too great. I stopped to listen.
Was it not right, or at least justifiable curiosity on my
part?</p>

<p>"Why indispensable?" replied papa. "I know the
young fellow. I've often met him at the club. I've
even played whist with him. He doesn't play badly,
either. He saw Irene on horseback, and thought she
was superb. That settles the whole affair as far as I
am concerned. What business is it of mine? It's only
your affair—your's and Irene's."</p>

<p>"My dear, I assure you that propriety demands—"</p>

<p>"Well, well; I'll go, I'll go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1385">[Pg 1385]</span></p>

<p>Then silence fell. Not another word was spoken.
I waited to hear the man's name, but it didn't come.
My heart beat a little quicker as I stood there in expectancy—in
fact, I distinctly heard its tick-tack. I
stood two or three minutes, but as they did not think
fit to resume the conversation, I entered, and had to
pretend to know nothing.</p>

<p>But I did know something, and that something was
of importance, too. He is a member of the "Jockey."
To me that means everything. If I attach too much
importance to it, it is papa's fault, for he thinks that
any one who is not a member of the Jockey is simply
nobody. The world, as far as papa is concerned, begins
with the Jockey, and ends at those who are not
of the charmed circle. I have been brought up with
those ideas. My husband must be a member of the
Jockey.</p>

<p>Well, the three of us set off in the landau—papa
gloomy, depressed, silent; mama in the same state of
eager excitement; I outwardly cool and indifferent,
but thinking hard all the same.</p>

<p>What could be the meaning of so much mystery?
This gentleman has seen me on horseback, and had
though I was bewitching, which was very sweet
of him. Was it he who had asked to see me in a
brilliantly-lighted room—<em>décolletée</em>?</p>

<p>That, it seemed to me, was scarcely the correct
thing. He ought to have been shown to <em>me</em> before
I was so liberally shown to him on horseback and on
foot. But, after all, it didn't matter much.</p>

<p>We got to the Mercerey's at half-past ten. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1386">[Pg 1386]</span>
very sorry for papa, for it really was a <em>soirée musicale</em>,
and there was a quartet, too, which is about the most
trying thing in the world for one who does not care
for music, and has not been broken in into bearing it.
In addition, the music was highly and wearily classical.</p>

<p>There were not many people present—only about a
score. The company was very mixed, and it was evident
that the affair had been arranged in a hurry, for
the people seemed to have been picked up haphazard,
with no thought for their peculiarities and idiosyncrasies—nobody
knew anybody, and there was an evident
lack of sympathy.</p>

<p>We entered just when the andante movement of a
sonata was in full swing, and we went on tiptoe to
seats. I settled myself snugly in a quiet corner and
cast a rapid, furtive glance round the battlefield. At
first I only saw a few old men—<em>blasé</em> looking individuals—evidently
not for me.</p>

<p>Then, in the opposite corner, I noticed a little knot
of four young men. There could be no doubt that
there was the enemy.</p>

<p>Yes, but which of the four? In my simplicity I
thought: "It must be he who is looking at me most
devotedly and attentively." I modestly lowered my
eyes, and assumed the attitude of a saint listening
with inward rapture to the austere strains of a Haydn
sonata.</p>

<p>Then suddenly I raised my eyes and let them fall
full upon the group of young men. But I had to drop
them more quickly than I had raised them, for all the
four young men were studying me with an equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1387">[Pg 1387]</span>
amount of curiosity and evident approbation. I let
the sonata go a little longer, and again renewed the
experiment—with the same result. The four pairs of
eyes were fixed unflinchingly upon me.</p>

<p>I don't think I was much put out by so much attention.
In fact, I wasn't at all put out. It was pleasant,
very pleasant; and I rather liked it than otherwise.</p>

<p>The country did wonders for me last summer. I
have grown a little—ever so little—fatter. Virginie,
my maid, said to me the other evening while dressing
me:</p>

<p>"Ah! Mademoiselle, you don't know how the summer
has improved you." In which Virginie was very
much mistaken. Mademoiselle <em>did</em> know it very well.
One always notices such things first one's self.</p>

<p>The quartet at last came to an end, and the usual
confusion of tongues followed. I took mama aside
and said:</p>

<p>"Mama, do point him out."</p>

<p>"Why, you little minx, have you guessed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've guessed. Show me him—quick—the
music's going to start again."</p>

<p>"That's he—the tall dark man, on the left there—the
man standing under the Meissonnier. Don't look
just now. He's looking at you."</p>

<p>"He's not the only one. They're all doing that."</p>

<p>"He's not looking now, though. There he is. He's
going to papa. He's talking to him."</p>

<p>"He's not bad looking."</p>

<p>"I should rather think he isn't!"</p>

<p>"But his mouth's too large."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1388">[Pg 1388]</span></p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't think so."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes it is. But that's a trifle. On the whole,
he'll do."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you only knew all—birth, fortune, everything
you could wish for. It was such an extraordinary
accident, too—quite romantic."</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Comte de Martelle-Simieuse. Don't look at him;
he's beginning to look at you again. As I was saying,
he is a Martelle-Simieuse, and the Martelle-Simieuses
are cousins of the Landry-Simieuses and
of the Martelle-Jonzacs. You know the Martelle-Simieuses?"</p>

<p>At this point one of the musicians tapped on his
desk, and mama's flow of genealogical eloquence was
stopped. We resumed our seats, and the music commenced.
Mozart this time. I sank back into my corner
and settled down to my reflections. It was evident
to me that he must be a splendid catch, for mama was
so excited.</p>

<p>Comtesse de Martelle-Simieuse. Two names. Just
what I had dreamt of and longed for. Of course, I
should have preferred to be a duchess; but then there
are so few real dukes left—only twenty-two, I believe—so
that is practically out of the question. But a
countess is passable.</p>

<p>Comtesse de Martelle-Simieuse. The name would
sound well, I thought, and I repeated it several times
to convince myself. I paid no attention whatever to
Mozart. At first I scarcely realized that the musicians
were playing Mozart—it might have been Wagner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1389">[Pg 1389]</span>
All that I knew was that the musicians were playing
a melody which seemed to fit in with the words:
"Madame la Comtesse de Martelle-Simieuse."</p>

<p>After all a name <em>is</em> a matter of great importance,
and particularly a name which goes well with a title.
He is titled as well as a member of the "Jockey." <em>He</em>
must be titled. I wouldn't become plain "Madame"—no,
not for a fabulous fortune. Comtesse de Martelle-Simieuse.
Yes, certainly, that sounded very well.</p>

<p>When the quartette was over the conversation was
renewed. Papa turned toward mama, so did I. As
soon as I reached her, she said, excitedly: "The affair
is marching splendidly. He has asked to be introduced
to you, and papa noticed that his voice trembled—didn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied papa, "his voice trembled."</p>

<p>"Your papa is going to bring him up to introduce
him. If you are not satisfied with him, don't stay at
my side. If you are satisfied, stay."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall stay, mama; but it must be understood
that I shall have due time for reflection afterward.
You have promised not to hurry me."</p>

<p>"You will be quite free. But don't forget that it
is a chance in a hundred thousand. If you only knew
his relatives, and how well they are married. His
mother was a Précigny-Laroche. Think of that!
A P—"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I see."</p>

<p>"There is no better blood than that of the Précigny-Laroches."</p>

<p>"Keep calm, mama. Don't get so excited. People<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1390">[Pg 1390]</span>
are looking at you." Then papa fetched him, and we
had a nice chat in the interval. It was evident that
he was affected. He had had courage to stare at me
from a distance, but close at hand he daren't look at
me. I had to lead the conversation, and I managed in
ten minutes, while chatting apparently about the
most trivial topics, to learn all that was absolutely
necessary that I should know before letting things
go farther.</p>

<p>He loves Paris—so do I. He detests the country—so
do I. He thinks Trouville is very amusing—so do
I. He doesn't like shooting—nor do I. On the other
hand, he is passionately fond of horses and hunting—just
as I am. It is well that we agree on that point.
How many times have I said to myself, "My husband
will have a hunting-seat." He has one. He rents a
forest which is only ten leagues from Paris. You
leave Paris at half-past eight in the morning from the
Gare du Nord—the most convenient of stations—and
at half-past ten you are on horseback. And unless the
hunt is a very long one, you are back in Paris in the
evening for the theatre or a ball.</p>

<p>Then again, his time, his fortune, as well as he himself,
are entirely at his own disposal. He has neither
father nor mother. He has only a younger brother,
who is at present serving in an artillery regiment, and
a very rich and very old aunt, who has no children.
So he is the head of the family. Martelle-Simieuse
belongs to him. It is an estate somewhere out in Vendée.
Of course, I have not the remotest idea of going
and burying myself out in Vendée for half of the year;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1391">[Pg 1391]</span>
but it's quite necessary to have a country seat, and
Vendée is just as good as anywhere else.</p>

<p>All which information I picked up in the short space
of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at the outside.
Madame Mercerey, seeing that we were engaged in a
serious conversation, lengthened the interval for the
benefit of us four—I might say of us three, for papa
never uttered a word—might even say of us two, for
mama didn't say much either.</p>

<p>All the information I obtained by skilfully turning
the conversation in the most natural manner, and without
asking a single question.</p>

<p>This morning mama told me that she was absolutely
shocked at my calmness and precision last night. Yes,
I have a practical side to my nature. I am anxious to
place my life in certain unassailable conditions of independence
and security, without which there could be
neither happiness nor love, nor anything else worth
having.</p>

<p>For instance, I'm determined not to have a mother-in-law.
I don't know what I wouldn't give <em>not</em> to have
a mother-in-law. I don't intend to have to quarrel
with one. At home a wife should be at home, and
only have her husband to deal with.</p>

<p>It was on account of that decision that I rejected the
little Marquis de Marillac last year. He was one of
the five. I could have loved him; really, I had already
begun to. Then I saw his mother. Then I stopped.</p>

<p>She was a terrible creature—strict, lugubrious, and
ferociously <em>dévote</em>. She expected her daughter-in-law
to go and bury herself in the depths of Bretagne for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1392">[Pg 1392]</span>
eight months out of the twelve. Certainly, it would
have been a saving—but at what a cost! What slavery!
Besides, what would be the good of getting married,
if, the day after leaving girlhood, the wife had
to become a child and go back into leading-strings
again the next day?</p>

<p>Now let me see. Where was I? I've really quite
forgotten. Oh, I remember. The music began again,
as I said. It was the last piece. We four sat down
in a row in the following order: I, mama, papa, and
he. It was scarcely an hour before that I had first set
eyes on him, and we were already quite a little family
party, we four, sitting stupidly and stiffly in a straight
line on our chairs.</p>

<p>Some short waltzes of Beethoven were played, with
intervals of one minute between. During the first interval
mother said to me:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of him, now that you
have seen him?"</p>

<p>"The same as before, mama."</p>

<p>"Is he all right?"</p>

<p>"He'll do."</p>

<p>"Then your father may venture to ask him to
dinner?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that be hurrying matters rather too
much?"</p>

<p>"We must hurry matters."</p>

<p>"Why, mama?"</p>

<p>"Sh! They're going to begin again."</p>

<p>I was somewhat put out. What was the reason for
such unseemly haste? I was quite shocked by it. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1393">[Pg 1393]</span>
seemed really as if I were being thrown at the gentleman's
head. I was in a hurry to know the why and
the wherefore. I thought the concert would never
end.</p>

<p>After ages of waiting the second interval came, and
I began again:</p>

<p>"Mama, tell me why."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you anything just now. It would take
too long. I'll tell you all presently, when we get home.
But if he's invited it must be to-night; and there's not
a minute to lose—yes or no?"</p>

<p>"Mama, you're hurrying me."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not hurrying you. You are at liberty to
decline."</p>

<p>"Very well, then—yes."</p>

<p>"Dinner on Thursday?"</p>

<p>"Thursday will do very well."</p>

<p>Between the third and fourth waltzes, mama said
hurriedly to papa:</p>

<p>"Invite him to dinner."</p>

<p>"What day?"</p>

<p>"Thursday."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Papa has behaved with admirable docility and resignation.
I never saw him in such a serious <em>rôle</em> before.
It is true that the music seemed to bewilder him so that
he scarcely knew what he was doing. I felt restless,
and thought: "There, now, he'll go and invite the
wrong one." Nothing of the sort. He gave the
invitation quite correctly, and it was accepted with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1394">[Pg 1394]</span></p>

<p>We left at midnight, and before we had fairly got
away from Mercerey's I said to mama:</p>

<p>"I see clearly that you are as anxious as possible that
I should accept this man."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Then tell me—"</p>

<p>"Just let me get my breath first. I am quite exhausted.
I'll tell you everything when we get home."</p>

<p>An hour later I knew all. It was the most extraordinary
thing in the world. Yesterday morning at
eight o'clock a maid awoke mama, and gave her a
note marked "Important." It was from Madame de
Mercerey, and was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have a <em>migraine</em> and can not leave my room.
Come—come at once to see me. A splendid stroke of
luck for Irene."</p>
</div>

<p>Mama at once got up and went to Madame
Mercerey.</p>

<p>But I must leave the rest till to-morrow. We dine
at eight o'clock.</p>


<p class="right p1" style="padding-right: 2em;">
<em>November 27th.</em></p>

<p>Well, mama went off post-haste, and this is what
she heard from Madame Mercerey: "The two Martelle-Simieuses,
the elder, Adrien (he's mine), and the
younger, Paul, lost their grandmother ten years ago.
She was an excellent old lady—very rich and very
crotchety. She had one fixed idea—that of ensuring
the perpetuity of her family. She seemed to imagine
that if the Martelle-Simieuses became extinct the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1395">[Pg 1395]</span>
would of necessity come to an end. She was not by
any means stupid, and she caused a very ingenious and
peculiar clause to be inserted in her will, by which she
set aside 1,000,000 francs, which sum, together with
the accumulated interest, was to go to her grandson
Adrien if he married before reaching the age of
twenty-five. If he failed to marry within the time
stipulated, it passed to his brother Paul, on the same
conditions. If both brothers insisted on remaining
bachelors the money went to the poor. The trifle thus
set aside now amounts to the respectable sum of one
and a half millions. Adrien showed no inclination
to marry, but was addicted to sport, and wished above
all to maintain his independence. 'I will not marry,'
he used to say. 'I have an income of 180,000 francs,
and that's enough for me. With a little care and economy
I can make both ends meet.' In short, he regarded
the approach of the fatal 10th of January with perfect
complacency, although he knew that on that day he
would be twenty-five."</p>

<p>Toward the end of last year there was a great speculating
craze in our set—a sort of commercial crusade
against the infidel Jews. Adrien plunged into speculation,
not so much for the sake of gain as for excitement,
and to do good. He assisted in an attempt to
maintain the credit of a certain bank which was hard
pressed.</p>

<p>In the crash that ensued the poor fellow lost heavily—1,400,000
francs. So his income was reduced to 80,000,
and naturally he was very much pinched. But he
wasn't by any means depressed. He showed a brave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1396">[Pg 1396]</span>
face to misfortune, and at once set to work to reduce
his expenditure by dismissing some of his servants and
selling some of his horses.</p>

<p>His resolution not to marry remained unaltered.
But about a month ago some of his friends undertook
to show him the error of his ways. They pointed out
how absurd it was to stupidly let such a fortune slip
from his grasp, simply through want of decision to
close his hand, and that he might easily marry and get
a heap of money into the bargain, so that the unpleasantness
of marrying might be greatly alleviated. This
argument shook his resolution somewhat. He asked
his cousin, Madame de Riémens, to look out for a wife
for him. She sought, and found that great gawk Catherine
de Puymarin, who is very, <em>very</em> rich, but no more
figure than a lath. His first words when he saw her
were: "She is too slim, and won't look well on horseback."
From the moment that he began to entertain
the thought of marrying, he settled it as a <em>sine qua non</em>
that his wife must be a good horsewoman.</p>

<p>Time was flying, and Adrien's friends worried and
pressed him. He had begun by saying "No" to them.
Then he declined to say either "Yes" or "No." He
was in all probability going to say "Yes" when the
fateful and dramatic day arrived—November 24th.</p>

<p>On that eventful day, instead of going to ride in the
afternoon as I usually do, I had to go in the morning
with Monsieur Coates, who kindly considers me one
of his most brilliant pupils, and who occasionally does
the Bois with me.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock I drove out in a dog-cart with Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1397">[Pg 1397]</span>
Morton. We stopped near the Champignon, on the
right, at the entrance of the Bois, where Monsieur
Coates was waiting for me. The groom had brought
Triboulet, who doesn't always behave very well, and
on the day in question, as he hadn't been out of his
box for forty-eight hours, he was full of mischief, and
capered and pranced in fine style. I had had to dress
very hurriedly, as it happened, and Virginie had skewered
my hair into two balls, and to keep the puffs in
place she had stuck in about a dozen hairpins.</p>

<p>Monsieur Coates helped me to mount, but not without
some difficulty, for Triboulet was remarkably frisky
and disinclined to be mounted. As soon as he felt me
on his back he began to plunge, and tore off at full tilt.
But I am pretty much at home on horseback—besides,
I know how to manage Triboulet, and I punished him
soundly. Just, however, as we were in the middle of
our explanations I felt something rolling—rolling over
my shoulders. It was my hair, which had come down,
and was spreading itself in an avalanche, which carried
my hat away. So there I was, bareheaded—Triboulet
racing as hard as he could, and my hair flying out
behind.</p>

<p>At that precise moment, Adrien, Comte de Martelle-Simieuse,
rode down the Allée des Poteaux, and got a
view of the performance. He reined up at a respectful
distance, quite surprised at the unusual sight, and
in something less than no time he had given vent to
three little exclamations of admiration and wonder:</p>

<p>The first was for the horsewoman: "'Pon my word,
she does ride well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1398">[Pg 1398]</span></p>

<p>The second was for my hair: "What a magnificent
head of hair."</p>

<p>The third was for my face: "Gad—how pretty."</p>

<p>Triboulet, in the mean time, had got a little calmer.
The groom managed to find five of the scattered hairpins,
and I got my hair into a little better condition,
and fastened my veil around my head.</p>

<p>Finally, Monsieur Coates and I started, the groom
riding behind, and behind him rode the Comte de
Martelle-Simieuse, who made a second tour of the
Bois in my honor.</p>

<p>I, in my innocence, never dreamt of the conquest I
had made. The weather was rather cold and raw, and
we went at a good pace. Triboulet, stung by the keen
air, made several attempts at insurrection, but he soon
found out whom he had to deal with. Monsieur Coates
was very much pleased with me.</p>

<p>"This morning," said he, "you ride superbly—like
an angel"—which was also the opinion of my second,
self-appointed groom, who kept saying to himself:</p>

<p>"How well she rides! How well she rides!"</p>

<p>That was the idea which filled his head during the
ride, and he compared me with Catherine de Puymarin.</p>

<p>The ride finished, I went and found Miss Morton,
got into the dog-cart, and set off for the Rue de
Varennes. Young Martelle-Simieuse trotted behind
and acted as my escort home.</p>

<p>He waited until the door was opened and we had
entered, then he satisfied himself that I lived in a good
house, in a good street, and that from all appearances
I was no adventuress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1399">[Pg 1399]</span></p>

<p>What he then wanted was the name of the intrepid
Amazon. A very simple idea occurred to him. What
does the name matter for the moment? He returned
home, got the directory—Rue de Varennes, 49 <em>bis</em>,
Baron and Baronne de Léoty. That is how he discovered
the name of her who will perhaps become the
faithful partner of his joys and sorrows. Baron de
Léoty. He knew papa from the club. But had papa
a daughter? The mystery had to be solved.</p>

<p>It was very soon solved, for that evening Adrien
dined at the Mercerey's, and during a lull in the conversation
he said carelessly to Madame Mercerey: "Do
you happen to know a Monsieur de Léoty?"</p>

<p>"Quite well."</p>

<p>"Has he a daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How old is she?"</p>

<p>"About twenty."</p>

<p>"Very pretty, isn't she?"</p>

<p>At which, it appears, there was a general and enthusiastic
outburst in my honor. He was the only one
present who didn't know me, poor fellow. Madame
de Mercerey wanted to know the reason for all his inquiries.
So he recounted the story of the morning's
ride, my horse's obstinacy, my firmness, my hair flying
in the wind—in fact, it was quite a lyrical description,
which caused general stupefaction, for he had
never been heard to sing in that strain before.</p>

<p>Whereupon Madame de Mercerey showed presence
of mind which was as rare as it was admirable. <em>En
passant</em> it must be observed that she loves mama and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1400">[Pg 1400]</span>
hates the Puymarins heartily, although, until about six
weeks ago, they were the best of friends. She really
has good cause to be offended with them, though.</p>

<p>The Puymarins have given three <em>soirées</em> this year—the
Orléans princes were at one, and the Grand Duke
Vladimir at another, while the third was made up of
nobodies. Well, the Duchess invited the Mercereys
with the nobodies. Now, considering their birth and
fortune, they might reasonably have expected more
consideration than that. For that reason they are very
angry—and justifiably so.</p>

<p>Now comes Madame de Mercerey's stroke of genius.
Taking the ball, as it were, on the rise, without a moment's
hesitation, she said, in the presence of her husband,
who was stupefied at the assertion, that on the
following evening they were going to have a few
friends, among whom Madame and Mademoiselle
Léoty were invited, and that Monsieur de Martelle-Simieuse
would be welcome if he cared to come.
There would be some music, and he would have an
opportunity of seeing his fair heroine of the Bois.
Monsieur de Mercerey was thunderstruck:</p>

<p>"Aren't you mistaken in the date, my dear?" he
said. "We were surely going to the Gymnase to-morrow
night to see the new piece of Octave Feuillet."</p>

<p>"No, my dear; that is for the day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I thought that—I ordered the box myself."</p>

<p>"It is for the day after to-morrow, I tell you."</p>

<p>Upon which Monsieur subsided and got no further
explanation of the riddle until dinner was over. Madame
de Mercerey's exertions did not stop at that. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1401">[Pg 1401]</span>
took possession of Monsieur de Martelle-Simieuse, and
treated him to a eulogy of me.</p>

<p>"Irene de Léoty is just the girl to suit you—just the
wife you want. The meeting this morning was clearly
the work of Providence."</p>

<p>He repeated as refrain:</p>

<p>"How well she rides."</p>

<p>Yesterday, after having seen mama, Madame de
Mercerey, in spite of her <em>migraine</em>, courageously set to
work and took the field to get people together—engaged
musicians and got programs printed. What
admirable activity!</p>

<p>On what insignificant trifles our destiny hangs. If
Virginie had fastened my hair up properly, if Triboulet
had been quiet, if the Puymarins had not put the Mercereys
among the nobodies—Monsieur de Martelle-Simieuse
would not have been invited to dine at our
house to-morrow, and I should not be asking myself
the question:</p>

<p>"Shall I, or shall I not be Comtesse de Martelle-Simieuse?"</p>

<p>Poor Puymarins! They have come to Paris for the
sole purpose of exhibiting their phenomenon. Poor
Catherine de Puymarin! Shall I let her keep her
count, or shall I take him myself?</p>

<p>I don't yet know. But I do know that the sixth has
not made a bad start, and if I <em>had</em> to bet on the result,
I would not give odds.</p>


<p class="right p1" style="padding-right: 2em;">
<em>November 20th. Ten o'clock in the morning.</em></p>

<p>What deliberations there were about the dinner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1402">[Pg 1402]</span>
Should it be a big affair or a small one? Where
should <em>he</em> be placed? Opposite me or at my side?
Mama at first held out for opposite. She maintained
that I produce a much better effect <em>en face</em> than <em>en
profil</em>, especially when I am <em>décolletée</em>, and of course I
<em>was décolletée</em>. I stuck out for being at his side.
I didn't feel at all nervous at the idea of having him
near me. It was necessary to make him talk, so as to
be able to take his measure. I still held to my resolution
of not getting married without knowing what I
was doing. So, of course, he was put at my side—on
my right. So as not to be too hungry, and to have
plenty of time for cross-questioning, I had a pretty
substantial lunch at five o'clock. That left me free to
turn the conversation as I wished—which I did.</p>

<p>We were at table over an hour and a half, and at
the end of that time I was convinced that we were
made for each other. We first talked about carriages
and hunting. It was a splendid start. I discovered
immediately that his ideal of a horse is just the same
as mine—not too thin, and not too high—light certainly,
but not too slim; elegant, but well formed. I
think he was somewhat surprised to find that I was
<em>au fait</em> in such matters. About carriages and gear our
ideas are exactly the same.</p>

<p>He was both surprised and charmed. When dinner
began he was evidently excited and ill at ease, but as
we chatted, and I put him at his ease, the conversation
began to go swimmingly. We spoke the same language.
We were made to understand each other.</p>

<p>He hunts boars with a pack of eighty hounds—magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1403">[Pg 1403]</span>
animals of the best breed. He described
his hunting suit minutely—coat <em>à la française</em>, color of
dead leaves, facings and pockets of blue velvet. It
would be charming to have a costume to harmonize
with the dead leaves. I have already an idea for a
little hat—a dainty little thing.</p>

<p>One reason which induces me to favor him is that,
as a rule, we have to choose our husbands from among
men who have nothing to do, and who live lives of the
most appalling idleness. That is the reason why <em>ennui</em>
and fatigue ruins so many happy households.</p>

<p>His time is, however, quite occupied. He hasn't a
single minute of free time which he can really call his
own. His energy and intellect are employed in pursuits
which are at the same time useful and elegant.
He is one of the leaders of a very <em>chic clique</em>, which
has just been organized; member of the committee of
a pigeon-shooting society, and of a skaters' league; he
is interested in a society for steeplechasing, and is part
owner of a stud of race-horses. With so many irons
in the fire it is evident that he is fully occupied.</p>

<p>All which I had learned in half an hour. Then I
passed on to politics, and catechized him thereon. This
is a very, very important question, and I have fully
made up my mind to have no misunderstandings on
that head. Poor mama has suffered cruelly, and I am
resolved not to expose myself to like annoyances.</p>

<p>Mama has been very happy with papa—except from
a political standpoint. She was very young when she
was married. Her family was an ancient one, and of
strict monarchical principles. So was papa. So far, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1404">[Pg 1404]</span>
good. But toward the end of 1865 papa went over
to the Empire. It was not because his opinions had
changed—he took the step out of goodness of heart.
Poor papa is <em>so</em> good—too good in fact. His change
in politics was due to his devotion to my Uncle Armand,
his brother, who is now general of division. He was
only a captain then, and had had no promotion for
ages. He was not in favor because papa refused to set
foot in the Tuileries in spite of the many advances
made to him. So at last papa, who adored Uncle
Armand, accepted an invitation and promised to present
mama. That was a veritable triumph for the
Empire, for there is no bluer blood in France than
that of mama's family.</p>

<p>Mama passed the day of the presentation in tears.
She was, however, forced to obey, but <em>en route</em> there
was a frightful scene in the landau. Mama became
obstinate, and declared that she would not be presented.
She wanted to get out of the carriage into
the street, although she was wearing white satin shoes
and a crown of roses, and it was snowing heavily at
the time. At length she became quieter, and resigned
herself to her fate.</p>

<p>A fortnight afterward Uncle Armand received a
decoration, and at the end of six months was chief
of a squadron. But the affair caused many doors to
be shut against papa and mama. That caused him no
trouble—not a bit; in fact, he was rather pleased than
otherwise. He detests society, and always has his club.
But society is mama's life-breath, and she is not a
member of the "Jockey," so she suffered cruelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1405">[Pg 1405]</span></p>

<p>Nearly all the doors which were shut have since
been opened—that is to say, since the establishment of
the Republic, because since then many things have been
forgotten. The remainder would be thrown open to
me were I once Comtesse de Martelle-Simieuse. I
should be received everywhere with open arms. Since
the beginning of the century the political attitude of
the Martelle-Simieuses has been irreproachable. It did
not even trip during the Empire.</p>

<p>The Martelle-Simieuses can trace their pedigree,
fairly and without any trickery, back to the fourteenth
century. Adrien's mother—there, I am already
calling him Adrien—Adrien's mother was a Précigny-Laroche,
and as for his father—Adrien has published
a little book about his genealogy. Only a hundred
copies were printed and distributed among his friends.
Madame de Mercerey has a copy of it, which she lent
to mama. I have read it, and reread it, until I know
it by heart. It proves incontestably that Adrien is the
third in rank among the counts of France—not fourth,
but third.</p>

<p>Of course, one must naturally consider nobility of
heart and elevation of character in the first place, but
one must not forget to attach their real importance to
these other things. They are of enormous interest in
life, and especially at this particular moment, in the
midst of this flood of <em>soi disant</em> nobility, in the presence
of Spanish dukes and Italian princes, who are easily
able, if we can not prove that we are really of noble
family, to steal a march on us, and usurp our position
in society. I couldn't bear the thought of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1406">[Pg 1406]</span>
put at table at dinner with money-makers and literary
persons.</p>

<p>Another point demands attention, for nothing is too
trifling to notice when it is a question of making certain
definite arrangements for the comfort and pleasure
of after-life. One ought firmly to secure what one
wants. Mama has a box at the opera every Monday.
It has been understood, for some time past, that when
I marry I am to go halves on that box. Mama will
have it one Monday, and I the next. That's a very
good arrangement, and I am quite satisfied with it.</p>

<p>Now, if I marry Adrien, I shall have a box in the
first row, in front, at the Théâtre Français, every Tuesday
from December to June. This is how it will be
arranged. He has an aunt, a dear old aunt, very rich,
without children (so he is her heir), very old, asthmatic,
and she has the said box at the Théâtre Français.
She is quite willing to hand it over to him, for
she never uses it. She has not been in the theatre for
over three years. What a dear old aunt she is!</p>

<p>All that information I got out of him between the
soup and the cheese. So, when, after dinner, mama
rushed to me and said, "Well?" I replied:</p>

<p>"I don't think I could find a better."</p>

<p>"Then it's settled?"</p>

<p>"Two are necessary for a marriage."</p>

<p>"Oh, you may set your mind at rest on that score.
You are two. I have been watching you the whole
time during dinner. His head is quite turned."</p>

<p>That was my opinion, too. When mama rushed
to me, he rushed off to Madame Mercerey, who, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1407">[Pg 1407]</span>
course, was of the party. He loved me to distraction;
adored me, would marry only me—me and nobody
else. And he besought Madame Mercerey to go and
demand me from mama at once.</p>

<p>She had to try to pacify him, and to show him that
one must not act too rashly. Mama, for her part,
would have been quite contented to settle the affair at
once. She had a dread of the machinations of the
Puymarin clique.</p>

<p>I didn't share her fear in the least. I recognized
clearly what an effect I had produced, and I felt that
I was mistress of the situation. So I reminded mama
of her promises, and of my resolution only to come to
a decision when I had carefully weighed the pros and
cons, and said that I had only seen him twice—each
time in evening dress. I was determined to see him
twice in the daytime, and in frock coat. I knew how
Cousin Mathilde had managed. She saw her husband
twice in the daytime—once in the Louvre and once at
the Hippodrome. As there was no Hippodrome where
I could see Adrien, I would substitute the museum at
Cluny. I was determined, however, to have my two
interviews in broad daylight.</p>

<p>So Madame Mercerey arranged an accidental meeting
at the Louvre for to-day at three o'clock punctually,
in front of Murillo's "Virgin."</p>


<p class="right p1" style="padding-right: 2em;">
<em>The same day. Five o'clock.</em><br>
</p>

<p>We have just returned from an hour's stroll in the
galleries, where we did not pay much attention to the
pictures. I imagine that he is surprisingly ignorant of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1408">[Pg 1408]</span>
pictures. But then I have no thought of marrying an
art critic. He has <em>such</em> a fine figure, and dresses <em>so</em>
well. He speaks very little, is very reserved, but very
correct; and above all, never makes stupid remarks.
Taking him altogether, I am quite contented.</p>

<p>As soon as we were alone in the carriage in the Rue
Rivoli, I had to repulse another attack from mama:</p>

<p>"He's simply charming. I should think that you
would never insist on Cluny now."</p>

<p>"No. I waive that. Never mind Cluny."</p>

<p>"That's right. Then you've decided?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, mama; not yet. One oughtn't to rush
madly into marriage after having got a little information
about a man's fortune and situation."</p>

<p>"But what more do you want?"</p>

<p>"To see him on horseback. He's seen me riding,
but I haven't seen him."</p>

<p>In short, Madame de Mercerey, whose devotion is
indefatigable, is going to advise him to-night to go
and ride about at the entrance of the Avenue des
Acacias about ten o'clock to-morrow morning. As
inducement she will hint delicately that he may possibly
meet papa and me. For papa—I must say that
papa astonishes me—he is acting the <em>rôle</em> of a father
who has a marriageable daughter to perfection. He
hasn't mounted a horse for four years, but to-morrow
he is going to risk a broken neck.</p>


<p class="right p1" style="padding-right: 2em;"><em>November 20th.</em></p>

<p>We had a ride round the Bois—all three of us—papa,
he, and I. <em>He</em> looks very well on horseback. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1409">[Pg 1409]</span>
rode a splendid bay mare. I will take her for myself,
and will pass Triboulet on to him, for I know Triboulet
too well, and am tired of him.</p>

<p>On my return I flung my arms round mama's
neck—</p>

<p>"Yes, a thousand times," I said.</p>

<p>And with tears in my eyes, I thanked her for
having been so indulgent, so good, so patient.</p>


<p class="right p1" style="padding-right: 2em;"><em>December 4th.</em></p>

<p>To-day at three o'clock the old aunt who has the
box at the theatre on Tuesdays is to come to demand
my hand officially, and so before the 10th of January
(that will be absolutely necessary because of the
grandmother's will) I shall be Comtesse de Martelle-Simieuse.
Adrien will get the one and a half millions
and me into the bargain, as extra consolation prize. I
think it will be money easily gained. I don't think that
he is much to be pitied.</p>


<p class="right p1" style="padding-right: 2em;"><em>December 11th.</em></p>

<p>The wedding is fixed for January 6th. It is absurd
to get married at such a time, but it couldn't be arranged
otherwise. The will! The will! Besides,
after all, the date doesn't displease me so very much.
We shall have a short—a <em>very</em> short—honeymoon—a
few days at Nice—ten days at the outside.</p>

<p>After that Paris in full swing, with all the theatres
open. The unfortunate Louise de Montbrian got
married last spring—at the end of May, and returned
to Paris after a six-weeks' honeymoon only to find the
city torrid and sinister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1410">[Pg 1410]</span></p>

<p>We shall be supremely happy—of that I haven't the
slightest doubt. He adores me. And I! Do I love
him? Well, I must be candid with myself, and it
would not be true if I declared, in the phrases so common
in English novels, that I love him madly; that I
only really live when he is present; that I tremble
at the sound of his footsteps, and start when I hear
his voice.</p>

<p>Oh, no! I am not so easily moved. My heart can't
be expected to go at that rate. But I already like him
very much. Love will come in time, I have no doubt.</p>

<p>Love is such an economizer in a household. I bring
a million, and we can reckon on an income of about
230,000 francs. That may at first sight seem a very
large income, but it isn't really so. First of all we
must deduct about 80,000 francs for the keeping up
of Simieuse, our château in Vendée, and for hunting.
That will leave only 150,000 francs for living expenses,
which amount will be quite sufficient if we love
each other and pull together <em>en bon camarade</em>.</p>

<p>But if, on the contrary, we begin after a short time—and
this is the history of many households—to pull
in opposite directions, we shall only have 75,000 francs
each, and that will mean pinching—supposing that
theatres—leaving the opera and the Théâtre Français
out of the reckoning—cost 2,000 or 3,000 francs a
year if we go together, it would at once be double that
sum if we went separately. And so with everything
else—the expenditure doubled.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, Caroline and her husband. They
have only 100,000 francs per annum, but they live well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1411">[Pg 1411]</span>
and without economizing. Why? Because they love
each other. They have quite a small house, and naturally
don't require a host of servants. They receive
little, and rarely go out. The more they are with each
other, the more they see of each other, the more they
are satisfied. Caroline is quite content, too, with 12,000
francs for her toilet.</p>

<p>Take Adèle as an example of the contrary. Poor
girl, she married very much against her own will and
judgment. Her mother was dazzled by the title. Certainly
a title is something—in fact, it is a great deal—but
it is not exactly everything. Well, her marriage
with Gontran turned out badly. Things went wrong
from the first week. Consequently they find themselves
pinched in spite of their great income of 250,000
francs. She spends a fortune on clothes, on stupid
whims. It costs her much more to satisfy the whole
world than it would to please one individual. The
Duke, in consequence, has taken to play, and has
already squandered half of his fortune.</p>

<p>Caroline said to me recently:</p>

<p>"As soon as you are married try to love your husband.
In our set that means a saving of at least 100,000
per annum, and even if people can't love each other
for love's sake, they ought to for convenience."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I'll love him. I'll love him. Besides,
it's only the 11th of December. Between now and the
6th of January I have still twenty-six days before me."</p>

<p><em>Émile Gaboriau, best known for his remarkable
detective stories, was born at Sanson
in 1853, and died at Paris in 1873. He was
for a time private secretary of Paul Féval,
the novelist, and published a great variety
of work. In 1866 appeared in the paper called
"Le Pays" his first great detective story,
"L'Affaire Lerouge," which the author dramatized
in collaboration with Hostein in 1872.
Like all of the great series, "L'Affaire Lerouge,"
"Monsieur Lecoq," "Les Esclaves de
Paris," etc., are written in an easy flowing
style, and are full of exciting moments.</em></p>

<p><em>It is interesting to trace the ancestry of the
modern detective story. The first seeds are
said to be found in Voltaire's "Zadig"; they
germinate in Poe's tales, take form in Gaboriau,
and are in full bloom in Conan Doyle's
"Sherlock Holmes."</em></p>

Publishing Company.</p>


<p>The Vicomte de B——, an amiable and
charming young man, was peacefully enjoying
an income of 30,000 livres yearly,
when, unfortunately for him, his uncle, a miser of
the worst species, died, leaving him all his wealth,
amounting to nearly two millions.</p>

<p>In running through the documents of succession,
the Vicomte de B—— learned that he was the proprietor
of a house in the Rue de la Victoire. He
learned, also, that the unfurnished building, bought in
1849 for 300,000 francs, now brought in, clear of
taxes, rentals amounting to 82,000 francs a year.</p>

<p>"Too much, too much, entirely," thought the generous
vicomte, "my uncle was too hard; to rent at this
price is usury, one can not deny it. When one bears
a great name like mine, one should not lend himself
to such plundering. I will begin to-morrow to lower
my rents, and my tenants will bless me."</p>

<p>With this excellent purpose in view, the Vicomte
de B—— sent immediately for the <em>concièrge</em> of the
building, who presented himself as promptly, with
back bent like a bow.</p>

<p>"Bernard, my friend," said the vicomte, "go at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1416">[Pg 1416]</span>once from me and notify all your tenants that I lower
their rents by one-third."</p>

<p>That unheard-of word "lower" fell like a brick on
Bernard's head. But he quickly recovered himself;
he had heard badly; he had not understood.</p>

<p>"Low—er the rents!" stammered he. "Monsieur
le Vicomte deigns to jest. Lower! Monsieur, of
course means to raise the rents."</p>

<p>"I was never more serious in my life, my friend,"
the vicomte returned; "I said, and I repeat it, lower
the rents."</p>

<p>This time the <em>concièrge</em> was surprised to the point
of bewilderment—so thrown off his balance that he
forgot himself and lost all restraint.</p>

<p>"Monsieur has not reflected," persisted he. "Monsieur
will regret this evening. Lower the tenants'
rents! Never was such a thing known, monsieur!
If the lodgers should learn of it, what would they
think of monsieur? What would people say in the
neighborhood? Truly—"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Bernard, my friend," dryly interrupted
the vicomte, "I prefer, when I give an order, to be
obeyed without reply. You hear me—go!"</p>

<p>Staggering like a drunken man, Monsieur Bernard
went out from the house of his proprietor.</p>

<p>All his ideas were upset, overthrown, confounded.
Was he, or was he not, the plaything of a dream, a
ridiculous nightmare? Was he himself Pierre Bernard,
or Bernard somebody else?</p>

<p>"Lower his rents! lower his rents!" repeated he.
"It is not to be believed! If indeed the lodgers had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1417">[Pg 1417]</span>
complained! But they have not complained; on the
contrary, all are good payers. Ah! if his uncle could
only know this, he would rise from the tomb! His
nephew has gone mad, 'tis certain! Lower the rents!
They should have up this young man before a family
council; he will finish badly! Who knows—after this—what
he will do next? He lunched too well, perhaps,
this morning."</p>

<p>And the worthy Bernard was so pale with emotion
when he reentered his lodge, so pale and spent, that
on seeing him enter, his wife and daughter Amanda
exclaimed as with one voice:</p>

<p>"Goodness! what is it? What has happened to
you now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," responded he, with altered voice, "absolutely
nothing."</p>

<p>"You are deceiving me," insisted Madame Bernard,
"you are concealing something from me; do not spare
me; speak, I am strong—what did the new proprietor
tell you? Does he think of turning us off?"</p>

<p>"If it were only that! But just think, he told me
with his own lips, he told me to—ah! you will never
believe me—"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; only do go on."</p>

<p>"You will have it, then!—Well, then, he told me,
he ordered me to notify all the tenants that—<em>he lowered
their rents one-third</em>! Did you hear what I said?—<em>lowered</em>
the rents of the tenants—"</p>

<p>But neither Madame nor Mademoiselle Bernard
heard him out—they were twisting and doubling with
convulsive laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1418">[Pg 1418]</span></p>

<p>"Lower!" repeated they; "ah! what a good joke,
what a droll man! Lower the tenants' rents."</p>

<p>But Bernard, losing his temper and insisting that
he must be taken seriously in his own lodge, his wife
lost her temper too, and a quarrel followed! Madame
Bernard declaring that Monsieur Bernard had,
beyond a doubt, taken his fantastic order from the
bottom of a litre of wine in the restaurant at the
corner.</p>

<p>But for Mademoiselle Amanda the couple would
undoubtedly have come to blows, and finally Madame
Bernard, who did not wish to be thought demented,
threw a shawl over her head and ran to the proprietor's
house. Bernard had spoken truly; with her own
two ears, ornamented with big, gilded hoops, she heard
the incredible word. Only, as she was a wise and prudent
woman, she demanded "a bit of writing," to put,
as she said, "her responsibility under cover."</p>

<p>She, too, returned thunderstruck, and all the
evening in the lodge, father, mother, and daughter
deliberated.</p>

<p>Should they obey? or should they warn some relative
of this mad young man, whose common sense
would oppose itself to such insanity?</p>

<p>They decided to obey.</p>

<p>Next morning, Bernard, buttoning himself into his
best frock coat, made the rounds of the three-and-twenty
lodges to announce his great news.</p>

<p>Ten minutes afterward the house in the Rue de la
Victoire was in a state of commotion impossible to
describe. People who, for forty years had lived on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1419">[Pg 1419]</span>
the same floor, and never honored each other with so
much as a tip of the hat, now clustered together and
chatted eagerly.</p>

<p>"Do you know, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"It is very extraordinary."</p>

<p>"Simply unheard of!"</p>

<p>"The proprietor's lowered my rent!"</p>

<p>"One-third, is it not? Mine also."</p>

<p>"Astounding! It <em>must</em> be a mistake!"</p>

<p>And despite the affirmations of the Bernard family,
despite even the "bit of writing," "under cover," there
were found among the tenants doubting Thomases,
who doubted still in the face of everything.</p>

<p>Three of them actually wrote to the proprietor to
tell him what had passed, and to charitably warn him
that his <em>concièrge</em> had wholly lost his mind. The proprietor
responded to these skeptics, confirming what
Bernard had said. Doubt, thereafter, was out of the
question.</p>

<p>Then began reflections and commentaries.</p>

<p>"<em>Why</em> had the proprietor lowered his rents?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <em>why</em>?"</p>

<p>"What motives," said they all, "actuate this strange
man? For certainly he must have grave reasons for
a step like this! An intelligent man, a man of good
sense, would never deprive himself of good fat revenues,
well secured, for the simple pleasure of depriving
himself. One would not conduct himself thus
without being forced, constrained by powerful or terrible
circumstances."</p>

<p>And each said to himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1420">[Pg 1420]</span></p>

<p>"<em>There is something under all this!</em>"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>And from the first floor to the sixth they sought and
conjectured and delved in their brains. Every lodger
had the preoccupied air of a man that strives with all
his wits to solve an impossible cipher, and everywhere
there began to be a vague disquiet, as it happens when
one finds himself in the presence of a sinister mystery.</p>

<p>Some one went so far as to hazard:</p>

<p>"This man must have committed a great and still
hidden crime; remorse pushes him to philanthropy."</p>

<p>"It was not a pleasant idea, either, the thought of
living thus side by side with a rascal; no, by no means;
he might be repentant, and all that, but suppose he
yielded to temptation once more!"</p>

<p>"The house, perhaps, was badly built?" questioned
another, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Hum-m, so-so! no one could tell; but all knew one
thing—it was very, very old!"</p>

<p>"True! and it had been necessary to prop it
when they dug the drain last year in the month of
March."</p>

<p>"Maybe it was the roof, then, and the house is top-heavy?"
suggested a tenant on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>"Or perhaps," said a lodger in the garret, "there is
a press for coining counterfeit money in the cellar; I
have often heard at night a sound like the dull, muffled
thud of a coin-stamper."</p>

<p>The opinion of another was that Russian, maybe
Prussian, spies had gained a lodgment in the house,
while the gentleman of the first story was inclined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1421">[Pg 1421]</span>
believe that the proprietor purposed to set fire to his
house and furniture with the sole object of drawing
great sums from the insurance companies.</p>

<p>Then began to happen, as they all declared, extraordinary
and even frightful things. On the sixth and
mansard floors it appeared that strange and absolutely
inexplicable noises were heard. Then the nurse of the
old lady on the fourth story, going one night to steal
wine from the cellar, encountered the ghost of the defunct
proprietor—he even held in his hand a receipt for
rent—by which she knew him!</p>

<p>And the refrain from loft to cellar was:</p>

<p>"There is something under all this!"</p>

<p>From disquietude it had come to fright; from fright
it quickly passed to terror. So that the gentleman of
the first floor, who had valuables in his rooms, made up
his mind to go, and sent in notice by his clerk.</p>

<p>Bernard went to inform the proprietor, who
responded:</p>

<p>"All right, let the fool go!"</p>

<p>But next day the chiropodist of the second floor,
though he had naught to fear for his valuables, imitated
the gentleman beneath him. Then the bachelors
and the little households of the fifth story quickly followed
this example.</p>

<p>From that moment it was a general rout. By the
end of the week, everybody had given notice. Every
one awaited some frightful catastrophe. They slept no
more. They organized patrols. The terrified domestics
swore that they too would quit the accursed house
and remained temporarily only on tripled wages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1422">[Pg 1422]</span></p>

<p>Bernard was no more than the ghost of himself; the
fever of fear had worn him to a shadow.</p>

<p>"No," repeated his wife mournfully at each fresh
notification, "no, it is <em>not</em> natural."</p>

<p>Meanwhile three-and-twenty "For Rent" placards
swung against the façade of the house, drawing an
occasional applicant for lodgings.</p>

<p>Bernard—never grumbling now—climbed the staircase
and ushered the visitor from apartment to apartment.</p>

<p>"You can have your choice," said he to the people
that presented themselves, "the house is entirely
vacant; all the tenants have given notice as one man.
They do not know why, exactly, but things have happened,
oh! yes, <em>things</em>! a mystery such as was never
before known—<em>the proprietor has lowered his rents!</em>"</p>

<p>And the would-be lodgers fled away affrighted.</p>

<p>The term ended, three-and-twenty vans carried away
the furniture of the three-and-twenty tenants. Everybody
left. From top to bottom, from foundations to
garret, the house lay empty of lodgers.</p>

<p>The rats themselves, finding nothing to live on,
abandoned it also.</p>

<p>Only the <em>concièrge</em> remained, gray green with fear
in his lodge. Frightful visions haunted his sleep. He
seemed to hear lugubrious howlings and sinister murmurs
at night that made his teeth chatter with terror
and his hair erect itself under his cotton nightcap.
Madame Bernard no more closed an eye than he. And
Amanda in her frenzy renounced all thought of the
operatic stage and married—for nothing in the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1423">[Pg 1423]</span>
but to quit the paternal lodge—a young barber and
hair-dresser whom she had never before been able to
abide.</p>

<p>At last, one morning, after a more frightful nightmare
than usual, Bernard, too, took a great resolution.
He went to the proprietor, gave up his keys, and
scampered away.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And now on the Rue de la Victoria stands the abandoned
house, "The Accursed House," whose history I
have told you. Dust thickens upon the closed slats,
grass grows in the court. No tenant ever presents
himself now; and in the quarter, where stands this
Accursed House, so funereal is its reputation that even
the neighboring houses on either side of it have also
depreciated in value.</p>

<p>Lower one's rents!! Who would think of such a
thing!!!</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Coqueville is a little village planted in a
cleft in the rocks, two leagues from Grandport.
A fine sandy beach stretches in front of the
huts lodged half-way up in the side of the cliff like
shells left there by the tide. As one climbs to the
heights of Grandport, on the left the yellow sheet of
sand can be very clearly seen to the west like a river
of gold dust streaming from the gaping cleft in the
rock; and with good eyes one can even distinguish the
houses, whose tones of rust spot the rock and whose
chimneys send up their bluish trails to the very crest
of the great slope, streaking the sky. It is a deserted
hole. Coqueville has never been able to attain to the
figure of two hundred inhabitants. The gorge which
opens into the sea, and on the threshold of which the
village is planted, burrows into the earth by turns so
abrupt and by descents so steep that it is almost impossible
to pass there with wagons. It cuts off all communication
and isolates the country so that one seems
to be a hundred leagues from the neighboring hamlets.
Moreover, the inhabitants have communication with
Grandport only by water. Nearly all of them fishermen,
living by the ocean, they carry their fish there
every day in their barks. A great commission house,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1428">[Pg 1428]</span>the firm of Dufeu, buys their fish on contract. The
father Dufeu has been dead some years, but the widow
Dufeu has continued the business; she has simply engaged
a clerk, M. Mouchel, a big blond devil, charged
with beating up the coast and dealing with the fishermen.
This M. Mouchel is the sole link between Coqueville
and the civilized world.</p>

<p>Coqueville merits a historian. It seems certain
that the village, in the night of time, was founded by
the Mahés; a family which happened to establish itself
there and which grew vigorous at the foot of the cliff.
These Mahés continued to prosper at first, marrying
continually among themselves, for during centuries one
finds none but Mahés there. Then under Louis XIII
appeared one Floche. No one knew too much of where
he came from. He married a Mahé, and from that time
a phenomenon was brought forth; the Floches in their
turn prospered and multiplied exceedingly, so that they
ended little by little in absorbing the Mahés whose
numbers diminished until their fortune passed entirely
into the hands of the newcomers. Without doubt, the
Floches brought new blood, more vigorous physical
organs, a temperament which adapted itself better to
that hard condition of high wind and of high sea. At
any rate, they are to-day masters of Coqueville.</p>

<p>It can easily be understood that this displacement
of numbers and of riches was not accomplished without
terrible disturbances. The Mahés and the Floches
detest each other. Between them is a hatred of centuries.
The Mahés in spite of their decline retain the
pride of ancient conquerors. After all they are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1429">[Pg 1429]</span>
founders, the ancestors. They speak with contempt
of the first Floche, a beggar, a vagabond picked up by
them from feelings of pity, and to have given away
one of their daughters to whom was their eternal regret.
This Floche, to hear them speak, had engendered
nothing but a descent of libertines and thieves,
who pass their nights in raising children and their days
in coveting legacies. And there is not an insult they do
not heap upon the powerful tribe of Floche, seized
with that bitter rage of nobles, decimated, ruined, who
see the spawn of the bourgeoisie master of their rents
and of their châteaux. The Floches, on their side,
naturally have the insolence of those who triumph.
They are in full possession, a thing to make them insolent.
Full of contempt for the ancient race of the
Mahés, they threaten to drive them from the village
if they do not bow their heads. To them they are
starvelings, who instead of draping themselves in their
rags would do much better to mend them.</p>

<p>So Coqueville finds itself a prey to two fierce factions—something
like one hundred and thirty inhabitants
bent upon devouring the other fifty for the
simple reason that they are the stronger.</p>

<p>The struggle between two great empires has no
other history.</p>

<p>Among the quarrels which have lately upset Coqueville,
they cite the famous enmity of the brothers,
Fouasse and Tupain, and the ringing battles of the
Rouget ménage. You must know that every inhabitant
in former days received a surname, which has become
to-day the regular name of the family; for it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1430">[Pg 1430]</span>
difficult to distinguish one's self among the cross-breedings
of the Mahés and the Floches. Rouget assuredly
had an ancestor of fiery blood. As for Fouasse and
Tupain, they were called thus without knowing why,
many surnames having lost all rational meaning in
course of time. Well, old Françoise, a wanton of
eighty years who lived forever, had had Fouasse by
a Mahé, then becoming a widow, she remarried with a
Floche and brought forth Tupain. Hence the hatred
of the two brothers, made specially lively by the question
of inheritance. At the Rouget's they beat each
other to a jelly because Rouget accused his wife,
Marie, of being unfaithful to him for a Floche, the
tall Brisemotte, a strong, dark man, on whom he had
already twice thrown himself with a knife, yelling
that he would rip open his belly. Rouget, a small,
nervous man, was a great spitfire.</p>

<p>But that which interested Coqueville most deeply
was neither the tantrums of Rouget nor the differences
between Tupain and Fouasse. A great rumor
circulated: Delphin, a Mahé, a rascal of twenty years,
dared to love the beautiful Margot, the daughter of
La Queue, the richest of the Floches and chief man
of the country. This La Queue was, in truth, a considerable
personage. They called him La Queue
because his father in the days of Louis Philippe, had
been the last to tie up his hair, with the obstinacy of
old age that clings to the fashions of its youth. Well,
then, La Queue owned one of the two large fishing
smacks of Coqueville, the "Zéphir," by far the best,
still quite new and seaworthy. The other big boat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1431">[Pg 1431]</span>the "Baleine," a rotten old patache,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> belonged to Rouget,
whose sailors were Delphin and Fouasse, while La
Queue took with him Tupain and Brisemotte. These
last had grown weary of laughing contemptuously at
the "Baleine"; a sabot, they said, which would disappear
some fine day under the billows like a handful of
mud. So when La Queue learned that that ragamuffin
of a Delphin, the froth of the "Baleine," allowed himself
to go prowling around his daughter, he delivered
two sound whacks at Margot, a trifle merely to warn
her that she should never be the wife of a Mahé. As a
result, Margot, furious, declared that she would pass
that pair of slaps on to Delphin if he ever ventured to
rub against her skirts. It was vexing to be boxed on the
ears for a boy whom she had never looked in the face!
Margot, at sixteen years strong as a man and
handsome as a lady, had the reputation of being a
scornful person, very hard on lovers. And from that,
added to the trifle of the two slaps, of the presumptuousness
of Delphin, and of the wrath of Margot,
one ought easily to comprehend the endless gossip
of Coqueville.</p>


<div class="chapter"><figure class="figcenter illowe25" id="i-aft-p1430">
  <img class="w100 p2" src="images/i-aft-p1430.jpg" alt="ilozola" title="zolailo">
  <p class="caption p1b p2b">Émile Zola</p>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>Notwithstanding, certain persons said that Margot,
at bottom, was not so very furious at sight of Delphin
circling around her. This Delphin was a little blonde,
with skin bronzed by the sea-glare, and with a mane of
curly hair that fell over his eyes and in his neck.
And very powerful despite his slight figure; quite
capable of thrashing any one three times his size.
They said that at times he ran away and passed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1432">[Pg 1432]</span>
night in Grandport. That gave him the reputation
of a werwolf with the girls, who accused him, among
themselves, of "making a life of it"—a vague expression
in which they included all sorts of unknown
pleasures. Margot, when she spoke of Delphin, betrayed
too much feeling. He, smiling with an artful
air, looked at her with eyes half shut and glittering,
without troubling himself the least in the world over
her scorn or her transports of passion. He passed
before her door, he glided along by the bushes watching
for her hours at a time, full of the patience and
the cunning of a cat lying in wait for a tomtit; and
when suddenly she discovered him behind her skirts,
so close to her at times that she guessed it by the
warmth of his breath, he did not fly, he took on an air
gentle and melancholy which left her abashed, stifled,
not regaining her wrath until he was some distance
away. Surely, if her father saw her he would smite
her again. But she boasted in vain that Delphin would
some day get that pair of slaps she had promised him;
she never seized the moment to apply them when he was
there; which made people say that she ought not to talk
so much, since in the end she kept the slaps herself.</p>
</div>

<p>No one, however, supposed she could ever be Delphin's
wife. In her case they saw the weakness of a
coquette. As for a marriage between the most beggardly
of the Mahés, a fellow who had not six shirts to
set up housekeeping with, and the daughter of the
mayor, the richest heiress of the Floches, it would seem
simply monstrous. Evil tongues insinuated that she
could perfectly go with him all the same, but that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1433">[Pg 1433]</span>
would certainly not marry him. A rich girl takes her
pleasure as it suits her, only if she has a head, she does
not commit a folly. Finally all Coqueville interested
itself in the matter, curious to know how things would
turn out. Would Delphin get his two slaps? or else
Margot, would she let herself be kissed on both cheeks
in some hole in the cliff? They must see! There
were some for the slaps and there were some for the
kisses. Coqueville was in revolution.</p>

<p>In the village two people only, the curé and the
<em>garde champêtre</em>,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> belonged neither to the Mahés nor
to the Floches. The <em>garde champêtre</em>, a tall, dried-up
fellow, whose name no one knew, but who was called
the Emperor, no doubt because he had served under
Charles X, as a matter of fact exercised no burdensome
supervision over the commune which was all bare
rocks and waste lands. A sub-prefect who patronized
him had created for him the sinecure where he devoured
in peace his very small living.</p>

<p>As for the Abbé Radiguet, he was one of those
simple-minded priests whom the bishop, in his desire
to be rid of him, buries in some out of the way hole.
He lived the life of an honest man, once more turned
peasant, hoeing his little garden redeemed from the
rock, smoking his pipe and watching his salads grow.
His sole fault was a gluttony which he knew not how
to refine, reduced to adoring mackerel and to drinking,
at times, more cider than he could contain. In other
respects, the father of his parishioners, who came at
long intervals to hear a mass to please him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1434">[Pg 1434]</span></p>
<p>But the curé and the <em>garde champêtre</em> were obliged
to take sides after having succeeded for a long time
in remaining neutral. Now, the Emperor held for
the Mahés, while the Abbé Radiguet supported the
Floches. Hence complications. As the Emperor,
from morning to night, lived like a bourgeois [citizen],
and as he wearied of counting the boats which put out
from Grandport, he took it upon himself to act as
village police. Having become the partizan of the
Mahés, through native instinct for the preservation of
society, he sided with Fouasse against Tupain; he
tried to catch the wife of Rouget in <em>flagrante delicto</em>
with Brisemotte, and above all he closed his eyes when
he saw Delphin slipping into Margot's courtyard. The
worst of it was that these tactics brought about heated
quarrels between the Emperor and his natural superior,
the mayor La Queue. Respectful of discipline, the
former heard the reproaches of the latter, then recommenced
to act as his head dictated; which disorganized
the public authority of Coqueville. One could
not pass before the shed ornamented with the name
of the town hall without being deafened by the noise
of some dispute. On the other hand, the Abbé Radiguet
rallied to the triumphant Floches, who loaded
him with superb mackerel, secretly encouraged the
resistance of Rouget's wife and threatened Margot
with the flames of hell if she should ever allow Delphin
to touch her with his finger. It was, to sum up,
complete anarchy; the army in revolt against the civil
power, religion making itself complaisant toward the
pleasures of the bourgoisie; a whole people, a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1435">[Pg 1435]</span>
and eighty inhabitants, devouring each other in a hole,
in face of the vast sea, and of the infinite sky.</p>

<p>Alone, in the midst of topsy-turvy Coqueville, Delphin
preserved the laughter of a love-sick boy, who
scorned the rest, provided Margot was for him. He
followed her zigzags as one follows hares. Very wise,
despite his simple look, he wanted the curé to marry
them, so that his bliss might last forever.</p>

<p>One evening, in a byway where he was watching
for her, Margot at last raised her hand. But she
stopped, all red; for without waiting for the slap,
he had seized the hand that threatened him and
kissed it furiously. As she trembled, he said to her
in a low voice: "I love you. Won't you have me?"</p>

<p>"Never!" she cried, in rebellion.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, then with an air, calm
and tender, "Pray do not say that—we shall be very
comfortable together, we two. You will see how
nice it is."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>That Sunday the weather was appalling, one of
those sudden calamities of September that unchain
such fearful tempests on the rocky coast of Grandport.
At nightfall Coqueville sighted a ship in distress
driven by the wind. But the shadows deepened,
they could not dream of rendering help. Since the
evening before, the "Zéphir" and the "Baleine" had
been moored in the little natural harbor situated at
the left of the beach, between two walls of granite.
Neither La Queue nor Rouget had dared to go out;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1436">[Pg 1436]</span>
the worst of it was that M. Mouchel, representing the
Widow Dufeu, had taken the trouble to come in person
that Saturday to promise them a reward if they would
make a serious effort; fish was scarce, they were
complaining at the markets. So, Sunday evening,
going to bed under squalls of rain, Coqueville growled
in a bad humor. It was the everlasting story: orders
kept coming in while the sea guarded its fish. And
all the village talked of the ship which they had seen
passing in the hurricane, and which must assuredly
by that time be sleeping at the bottom of the water.
The next day, Monday, the sky was dark as ever.
The sea, still high, raged without being able to calm
itself, although the wind was blowing less strong.
It fell completely, but the waves kept up their furious
motion. In spite of everything, the two boats went
out in the afternoon. Toward four o'clock, the
"Zéphir" came in again, having caught nothing.
While the sailors, Tupain and Brisemotte, anchored
in the little harbor, La Queue, exasperated, on the
shore, shook his fist at the ocean. And M. Mouchel
was waiting! Margot was there, with the half of
Coqueville, watching the last surgings of the tempest,
sharing her father's rancor against the sea and the
sky.</p>

<p>"But where is the 'Baleine'?" demanded some one.</p>

<p>"Out there beyond the point," said La Queue. "If
that carcass comes back whole to-day, it will be by a
chance."</p>

<p>He was full of contempt. Then he informed them
that it was good for the Mahés to risk their skins in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1437">[Pg 1437]</span>
that way; when one is not worth a <em>sou</em>, one may
perish. As for him, he preferred to break his word
to M. Mouchel.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Margot was examining the point
of rocks behind which the "Baleine" was hidden.</p>

<p>"Father," she asked at last, "have they caught something?"</p>

<p>"They?" he cried. "Nothing at all."</p>

<p>He calmed himself and added more gently, seeing
the Emperor, who was sneering at him:</p>

<p>"I do not know whether they have caught anything,
but as they never do catch anything—"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, to-day, all the same, they have taken
something," said the Emperor ill-naturedly. "Such
things have been seen." La Queue was about to
reply angrily. But the Abbé Radiguet, who came
up, calmed him. From the porch of the church the
abbé had happened to observe the "Baleine"; and the
bark seemed to be giving chase to some big fish. This
news greatly interested Coqueville. In the groups
reunited on the shore there were Mahés and Floches,
the former praying that the boat might come in with
a miraculous catch, the others making vows that it
might come in empty.</p>

<p>Margot, holding herself very straight, did not take
her eyes from the sea. "There they are!" said she
simply.</p>

<p>And in fact a black dot showed itself beyond the
point. All looked at it. One would have said a cork
dancing on the water. The Emperor did not see
even the black dot. One must be of Coqueville to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1438">[Pg 1438]</span>
recognize at that distance the "Baleine" and those
who manned her.</p>

<p>"See!" said Margot, who had the best eyes of the
coast, "it is Fouasse and Rouget who are rowing—The
little one is standing up in the bow."</p>

<p>She called Delphin "the little one" so as not to mention
his name. And from then on they followed the
course of the bark, trying to account for her strange
movements. As the curé said, she appeared to be
giving chase to some great fish that might be fleeing
before her. That seemed extraordinary. The Emperor
pretended that their net was without doubt
being carried away. But La Queue cried that they
were do-nothings, and that they were just amusing
themselves. Quite certain they were not fishing for
seals! All the Floches made merry over that joke;
while the Mahés, vexed, declared that Rouget was a
fine fellow all the same, and that he was risking his
skin while others at the least puff of wind preferred
<em>terra firma</em>. The Abbé Radiguet was forced to interpose
again for there were slaps in the air.</p>

<p>"What ails them?" said Margot abruptly. "They
are off again!" They ceased menacing one another,
and every eye searched the horizon. The "Baleine"
was once more hidden behind the point. This time
La Queue himself became uneasy. He could not account
for such maneuvres. The fear that Rouget
was really in a fair way to catch some fish threw him
off his mental balance. No one left the beach, although
there was nothing strange to be seen. They stayed
there nearly two hours, they watched incessantly for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1439">[Pg 1439]</span>
the bark, which appeared from time to time, then disappeared.
It finished by not showing itself at all any
more. La Queue, enraged, breathing in his heart the
abominable wish, declared that she must have sunk;
and, as just at that moment Rouget's wife appeared
with Brisemotte, he looked at them both, sneering,
while he patted Tupain on the shoulder to console
him already for the death of his brother, Fouasse.
But he stopped laughing when he caught sight of his
daughter Margot, silent and looming, her eyes on the
distance; it was quite possibly for Delphin.</p>

<p>"What are you up to over there?" he scolded. "Be
off home with you! Mind, Margot!"</p>

<p>She did not stir. Then all at once: "Ah! there
they are!"</p>

<p>He gave a cry of surprise. Margot, with her good
eyes, swore that she no longer saw a soul in the bark;
neither Rouget, nor Fouasse, nor any one! The
"Baleine," as if abandoned, ran before the wind,
tacking about every minute, rocking herself with a
lazy air.</p>

<p>A west wind had fortunately risen and was driving
her toward the land, but with strange caprices
which tossed her to right and to left. Then all Coqueville
ran down to the shore. One half shouted to the
other half, there remained not a girl in the houses to
look after the soup. It was a catastrophe; something
inexplicable, the strangeness of which completely
turned their heads. Marie, the wife of Rouget, after
a moment's reflection, thought it her duty to burst into
tears. Tupain succeeded in merely carrying an air of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1440">[Pg 1440]</span>
affliction. All the Mahés were in great distress, while
the Floches tried to appear conventional. Margot collapsed
as if she had her legs broken.</p>

<p>"What are you up to again!" cried La Queue, who
stumbled upon her.</p>

<p>"I am tired," she answered simply.</p>

<p>And she turned her face toward the sea, her cheeks
between her hands, shading her eyes with the ends
of her fingers, gazing fixedly at the bark rocking itself
idly on the waves with the air of a good fellow who
has drunk too much.</p>

<p>In the mean while suppositions were rife. Perhaps
the three men had fallen into the water? Only,
all three at a time, that seemed absurd. La Queue
would have liked well to persuade them that the
"Baleine" had gone to pieces like a rotten egg; but
the boat still held the sea; they shrugged their
shoulders. Then, as if the three men had actually
perished, he remembered that he was Mayor and spoke
of formalities.</p>

<p>"Leave off!" cried the Emperor, "Does one die in
such a silly way?" "If they had fallen overboard,
little Delphin would have been here by this!"</p>

<p>All Coqueville had to agree, Delphin swam like a
herring. But where then could the three men be?
They shouted: "I tell you, yes!"—"I tell you, no!"—"Too
stupid!"—"Stupid yourself!" And matters
came to the point of exchanging blows. The Abbé
Radiguet was obliged to make an appeal for reconciliation,
while the Emperor hustled the crowd about
to establish order. Meanwhile, the bark, without haste,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1441">[Pg 1441]</span>
continued to dance before the world. It waltzed,
seeming to mock at the people; the sea carried her in,
making her salute the land in long rhythmic reverences.
Surely it was a bark in a crazy fit. Margot,
her cheeks between her hands, kept always gazing.
A yawl had just put out of the harbor to go to meet
the "Baleine." It was Brisemotte, who had exhibited
that impatience, as if he had been delayed in giving
certainty to Rouget's wife. From that moment all
Coqueville interested itself in the yawl. The voices
rose higher: "Well, does he see anything?" The
"Baleine" advanced with her mysterious and mocking
air. At last they saw him draw himself up and look
into the bark that he had succeeded in taking in tow.
All held their breath. But, abruptly, he burst out
laughing. That was a surprise; what had he to be
amused at? "What is it? What have you got there?"
they shouted to him furiously.</p>

<p>He, without replying, laughed still louder. He
made gestures as if to say that they would see. Then
having fastened the "Baleine" to the yawl, he towed
her back. And an unlooked-for spectacle stunned
Coqueville. In the bottom of the bark, the three men—Rouget,
Delphin, Fouasse—were beatifically stretched
out on their backs, snoring, with fists clenched, dead
drunk. In their midst was found a little cask stove in,
some full cask they had come across at sea and which
they had appreciated. Without doubt, it was very
good, for they had drunk it all save a liter's worth
which had leaked into the bark and which was mixed
with the sea water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1442">[Pg 1442]</span></p>

<p>"Ah! the pig!" cried the wife of Rouget, brutally,
ceasing to whimper.</p>

<p>"Well, it's characteristic—their catch!" said La
Queue, who affected great disgust.</p>

<p>"Forsooth!" replied the Emperor, "they catch what
they can! They have at least caught a cask, while
others have not caught anything at all."</p>

<p>The Mayor shut up, greatly vexed. Coqueville
brayed. They understood now. When barks are intoxicated,
they dance as men do; and that one, in
truth, had her belly full of liquor. Ah, the slut!
What a minx! She festooned over the ocean with
the air of a sot who could no longer recognize his
home. And Coqueville laughed, and fumed, the
Mahés found it funny, while the Floches found it
disgusting. They surrounded the "Baleine," they
craned their necks, they strained their eyes to see
sleeping there the three jolly dogs who were exposing
the secret springs of their jubilation, oblivious of the
crowd hanging over them. The abuse and the laughter
troubled them but little. Rouget did not hear his
wife accuse him of drinking up all they had; Fouasse
did not feel the stealthy kicks with which his brother
Tupain rammed his sides. As for Delphin, he was
pretty, after he had drunk, with his blond hair, his
rosy face drowned in bliss. Margot had gotten up,
and silently, for the present, she contemplated the
little fellow with a hard expression.</p>

<p>"Must put them to bed!" cried a voice.</p>

<p>But just then Delphin opened his eyes. He rolled
looks of rapture over the people. They questioned him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1443">[Pg 1443]</span>
on all sides with an eagerness that dazed him somewhat,
the more easily since he was still as drunk as a
thrush.</p>

<p>"Well! What?" he stuttered; "it was a little cask—There
is no fish. Therefore, we have caught a little
cask."</p>

<p>He did not get beyond that. To every sentence he
added simply: "It was very good!"</p>

<p>"But what was it in the cask?" they asked him
hotly.</p>

<p>"Ah! I don't know—it was very good."</p>

<p>By this time Coqueville was burning to know.
Every one lowered their noses to the boat, sniffing
vigorously. With one opinion, it smelt of liquor;
only no one could guess what liquor. The Emperor,
who flattered himself that he had drunk of everything
that a man can drink, said that he would see. He
solemnly took in the palm of his hand a little of the
liquor that was swimming in the bottom of the bark.
The crowd became all at once silent. They waited.
But the Emperor, after sucking up a mouthful, shook
his head as if still badly informed. He sucked twice,
more and more embarrassed, with an air of uneasiness
and surprise. And he was bound to confess:</p>

<p>"I do not know—It's strange—If there was no
salt water in it, I would know, no doubt—My word
of honor, it is very strange!"</p>

<p>They looked at him. They stood struck with awe
before that which the Emperor himself did not venture
to pronounce. Coqueville contemplated with respect
the little empty cask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1444">[Pg 1444]</span></p>

<p>"It was very good!" once more said Delphin, who
seemed to be making game of the people. Then, indicating
the sea with a comprehensive sweep, he added:
"If you want some, there is more there—I saw them—little
casks—little casks—little casks—"</p>

<p>And he rocked himself with the refrain which he
kept singing, gazing tenderly at Margot. He had
just caught sight of her. Furious, she made a motion
as if to slap him; but he did not even close his eyes;
he awaited the slap with an air of tenderness.</p>

<p>The Abbé Radiguet, puzzled by that unknown tipple,
he, too, dipped his finger in the bark and sucked it.
Like the Emperor, he shook his head: no, he was not
familiar with that, it was very extraordinary. They
agreed on but one point: the cask must have been
wreckage from the ship in distress, signaled Sunday
evening. The English ships often carried to Grandport
such cargoes of liquor and fine wines.</p>

<p>Little by little the day faded and the people were
withdrawn into shadow. But La Queue remained absorbed,
tormented by an idea which he no longer
expressed. He stopped, he listened a last time to
Delphin, whom they were carrying along, and who
was repeating in his sing-song voice: "Little casks—little
casks—little casks—if you want some, there are
more!"</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>That night the weather changed completely. When
Coqueville awoke the following day an unclouded sun
was shining; the sea spread out without a wrinkle, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1445">[Pg 1445]</span>
a great piece of green satin. And it was warm, one of
those pale glows of autumn.</p>

<p>First of the village, La Queue had risen, still
clouded from the dreams of the night. He kept looking
for a long time toward the sea, to the right, to the
left. At last, with a sour look, he said that he must
in any event satisfy M. Mouchel. And he went away
at once with Tupain and Brisemotte, threatening Margot
to touch up her sides if she did not walk straight.
As the "Zéphir" left the harbor, and as he saw the
"Baleine" swinging heavily at her anchor, he cheered
up a little, saying: "To-day, I guess, not a bit of it!
Blow out the candle, Jeanetton! those gentlemen have
gone to bed!"</p>

<p>And as soon as the "Zéphir" had reached the open
sea, La Queue cast his nets. After that he went to
visit his "jambins." The jambins are a kind of elongated
eel-pot in which they catch more, especially lobsters
and red gurnet. But in spite of the calm sea,
he did well to visit his jambins one by one. All were
empty; at the bottom of the last one, as if in mockery,
he found a little mackerel, which he threw back angrily
into the sea. It was fate; there were weeks like that
when the fish flouted Coqueville, and always at a time
when M. Mouchel had expressed a particular desire
for them. When La Queue drew in his nets, an hour
later, he found nothing but a bunch of seaweed.
Straightway he swore, his fists clenched, raging so
much the more for the vast serenity of the ocean,
lazy and sleeping like a sheet of burnished silver under
the blue sky. The "Zéphir," without a waver, glided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1446">[Pg 1446]</span>
along in gentle ease. La Queue decided to go in again,
after having cast his nets once more. In the afternoon
he came to see them, and he menaced God and the
saints, cursing in abominable words.</p>

<p>In the mean while, Rouget, Fouasse, and Delphin
kept on sleeping. They did not succeed in standing
up until the dinner hour. They recollected nothing,
they were conscious only of having been treated to
something extraordinary, something which they did
not understand. In the afternoon, as they were all
three down at the harbor, the Emperor tried to question
them concerning the liquor, now that they had
recovered their senses. It was like, perhaps, eau-de-vie
with liquorice-juice in it; or rather one might say
rum, sugared and burned. They said "Yes"; they
said "No." From their replies, the Emperor suspected
that it was ratafia; but he would not have sworn to it.
That day Rouget and his men had too many pains in
their sides to go a-fishing. Moreover, they knew that
La Queue had gone out without success that morning,
and they talked of waiting until the next day before
visiting their jambins. All three of them, seated on
blocks of stone, watched the tide come in, their backs
rounded, their mouths clammy, half-asleep.</p>

<p>But suddenly Delphin woke up; he jumped on to the
stone, his eyes on the distance, crying: "Look, Boss,
off there!"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Rouget, who stretched his limbs.</p>

<p>"A cask."</p>

<p>Rouget and Fouasse were at once on their feet, their
eyes gleaming, sweeping the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1447">[Pg 1447]</span></p>

<p>"Where is it, lad? Where is the cask?" repeated
the boss, greatly moved.</p>

<p>"Off there—to the left—that black spot."</p>

<p>The others saw nothing. Then Rouget swore an
oath. "Nom de Dieu!"</p>

<p>He had just spotted the cask, big as a lentil on the
white water in a slanting ray of the setting sun. And he
ran to the "Baleine," followed by Delphin and Fouasse,
who darted forward tapping their backs with their
heels and making the pebbles roll.</p>

<p>The "Baleine" was just putting out from the harbor
when the news that they saw a cask out at sea was
circulated in Coqueville. The children, the women,
began to run. They shouted: "A cask! a cask!"</p>

<p>"Do you see it? The current is driving it toward
Grandport."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! on the left—a cask! Come, quick!"</p>

<p>And Coqueville came; tumbled down from its rock;
the children arrived head over heels, while the women
picked up their skirts with both hands to descend
quickly. Soon the entire village was on the beach as
on the night before.</p>

<p>Margot showed herself for an instant, then she ran
back at full speed to the house, where she wished to
forestall her father, who was discussing an official
process with the Emperor. At last La Queue appeared.
He was livid; he said to the <em>garde champêtre</em>:
"Hold your peace! It's Rouget who has sent you
here to beguile me. Well, then, he shall not get it.
You'll see!"</p>

<p>When he saw the "Baleine," three hundred metres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1448">[Pg 1448]</span>
out, making with all her oars toward the black dot,
rocking in the distance, his fury redoubled. And he
shoved Tupain and Brisemotte into the "Zéphir," and
he pulled out in turn, repeating: "No, they shall not
have it; I'll die sooner!"</p>

<p>Then Coqueville had a fine spectacle; a mad race
between the "Zéphir" and the "Baleine." When the
latter saw the first leave the harbor, she understood
the danger, and shot off with all her speed. She may
have been four hundred metres ahead; but the chances
remained even, for the "Zéphir" was otherwise light
and swift; so excitement was at its height on the
beach. The Mahés and the Floches had instinctively
formed into two groups, following eagerly the vicissitudes
of the struggle, each upholding its own boat.
At first the "Baleine" kept her advantage, but as soon
as the "Zéphir" spread herself, they saw that she was
gaining little by little. The "Baleine" made a supreme
effort and succeeded for a few minutes in holding her
distance. Then the "Zéphir" once more gained upon
the "Baleine," came up with her at extraordinary
speed. From that moment on, it was evident that
the two barks would meet in the neighborhood of
the cask. Victory hung on a circumstance, on the
slightest mishap.</p>

<p>"The 'Baleine'! The 'Baleine'!" cried the Mahés.</p>

<p>But they soon ceased shouting. When the "Baleine"
was almost touching the cask, the "Zéphir," by a bold
maneuvre, managed to pass in front of her and throw
the cask to the left, where La Queue harpooned it
with a thrust of the boat-hook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1449">[Pg 1449]</span></p>

<p>"The 'Zéphir'! the 'Zéphir'!" screamed the Floches.</p>

<p>And the Emperor, having spoken of foul play, big
words were exchanged. Margot clapped her hands.
The Abbé Radiguet came down with his breviary,
made a profound remark which abruptly calmed the
people, and then threw them into consternation.</p>

<p>"They will, perhaps, drink it all, these, too," he
murmured with a melancholy air.</p>

<p>At sea, between the "Baleine" and the "Zéphir," a
violent quarrel broke out. Rouget called La Queue
a thief, while the latter called Rouget a good-for-nothing.
The men even took up their oars to beat each
other down, and the adventure lacked little of turning
into a naval combat. More than this, they engaged to
meet on land, showing their fists and threatening to
disembowel each other as soon as they found each
other again.</p>

<p>"The rascal!" grumbled Rouget. "You know, that
cask is bigger than the one of yesterday. It's yellow,
this one—it ought to be great." Then in accents of
despair: "Let's go and see the jambins; there may very
possibly be lobsters in them."</p>

<p>And the "Baleine" went on heavily to the left, steering
toward the point.</p>

<p>In the "Zéphir," La Queue had to get in a passion
in order to hold Tupain and Brisemotte from the cask.
The boat-hook, in smashing a hoop, had made a leaking
for the red liquid, which the two men tasted from
the ends of their fingers, and which they found exquisite.
One might easily drink a glass without its producing
much effect. But La Queue would not have it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1450">[Pg 1450]</span>
He caulked the cask and declared that the first who
sucked it should have a talk with him. On land, they
would see.</p>

<p>"Then," asked Tupain, sullenly, "are we going to
draw out the jambins?"</p>

<p>"Yes, right away; there is no hurry!" replied La
Queue.</p>

<p>He also gazed lovingly at the barrel. He felt his
limbs melt with longing to go in at once and taste it.
The fish bored him.</p>

<p>"Bah!" said he at the end of a silence. "Let's go
back, for it's late. We will return to-morrow." And
he was relaxing his fishing when he noticed another
cask at his right, this one very small, and which stood
on end, turning on itself like a top. That was the last
straw for the nets and the jambins. No one even spoke
of them any longer. The "Zéphir" gave chase to the
little barrel, which was caught very easily.</p>

<p>During this time a similar adventure overtook the
"Baleine." After Rouget had already visited five jambins
completely empty, Delphin, always on the watch,
cried out that he saw something. But it did not have
the appearance of a cask, it was too long.</p>

<p>"It's a beam," said Fouasse.</p>

<p>Rouget let fall his sixth jambin without drawing it
out of the water. "Let's go and see, all the same,"
said he.</p>

<p>As they advanced, they thought they recognized at
first a beam, a chest, the trunk of a tree. Then they
gave a cry of joy.</p>

<p>It was a real cask, but a very queer cask, such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1451">[Pg 1451]</span>
they had never seen before. One would have said a
tube, bulging in the middle and closed at the two
ends by a layer of plaster.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's comical!" cried Rouget, in rapture.
"This one I want the Emperor to taste. Come, children,
let's go in."</p>

<p>They all agreed not to touch it, and the "Baleine"
returned to Coqueville at the same moment as the
"Zéphir," in its turn, anchored in the little harbor.
Not one inquisitive had left the beach. Cries of joy
greeted that unexpected catch of three casks. The
<em>gamins</em> hurled their caps into the air, while the women
had at once gone on the run to look for glasses. It
was decided to taste the liquid on the spot. The wreckage
belonged to the village. Not one protest arose.
Only they formed into two groups, the Mahés surrounded
Rouget, the Floches would not let go of La
Queue.</p>

<p>"Emperor, the first glass for you!" cried Rouget.
"Tell us what it is."</p>

<p>The liquor was of a beautiful golden yellow. The
<em>garde champêtre</em> raised his glass, looked at it, smelt it,
then decided to drink.</p>

<p>"That comes from Holland," said he, after a long
silence.</p>

<p>He did not give any other information. All the
Mahés drank with deference. It was rather thick, and
they stood surprised, for it tasted of flowers. The
women found it very good. As for the men, they
would have preferred less sugar. Nevertheless, at the
bottom it ended by being strong at the third or fourth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1452">[Pg 1452]</span>
glass. The more they drank, the better they liked it.
The men became jolly, the women grew funny.</p>

<p>But the Emperor, in spite of his recent quarrels with
the Mayor, had gone to hang about the group of
Floches.</p>

<p>The biggest cask gave out a dark-red liquor, while
they drew from the smallest a liquid white as water
from the rock; and it was this latter that was the
stiffest, a regular pepper, something that skinned
the tongue.</p>

<p>Not one of the Floches recognized it, neither the
red nor the white.</p>

<p>There were, however, some wags there. It annoyed
them to be regaling themselves without knowing
over what.</p>

<p>"I say, Emperor, taste that for me!" said La Queue,
thus taking the first step.</p>

<p>The Emperor, who had been waiting for the invitation,
posed once more as connoisseur.</p>

<p>"As for the red," he said, "there is orange in
that! And for the white," he declared, "that—that
is excellent!"</p>

<p>They had to content themselves with these replies,
for he shook his head with a knowing air, with the
happy look of a man who has given satisfaction to
the world.</p>

<p>The Abbé Radiguet, alone, did not seem convinced.
As for him, he had the names on the tip of his tongue;
and to thoroughly reassure himself, he drank small
glasses, one after the other, repeating: "Wait, wait, I
know what it is. In a moment I will tell you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1453">[Pg 1453]</span></p>

<p>In the mean while, little by little, merriment grew in
the group of the Mahés and the group of the Floches.
The latter, particularly, laughed very loud because they
had mixed the liquors, a thing that excited them the
more. For the rest, the one and the other of the
groups kept apart. They did not offer each other of
their casks, they simply cast sympathetic glances, seized
with the unavowed desire to taste their neighbor's
liquor, which might possibly be better. The inimical
brothers, Tupain and Fouasse, were in close proximity
all the evening without showing their fists. It was
remarked, also, that Rouget and his wife drank from
the same glass. As for Margot, she distributed the
liquor among the Floches, and as she filled the glasses
too full, and the liquor ran over her fingers, she kept
sucking them continually, so well that, though obeying
her father who forbade her to drink, she became as
fuddled as a girl in vintage time. It was not unbecoming
to her; on the contrary, she got rosy all over,
her eyes were like candles.</p>

<p>The sun set, the evening was like the softness of
springtime. Coqueville had finished the casks and did
not dream of going home to dine. They found themselves
too comfortable on the beach. When it was
pitch night, Margot, sitting apart, felt some one blowing
on her neck. It was Delphin, very gay, walking on
all fours, prowling behind her like a wolf. She repressed
a cry so as not to awaken her father, who
would have sent Delphin a kick in the back.</p>

<p>"Go away, imbecile!" she murmured, half angry,
half laughing; "you will get yourself caught!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1454">[Pg 1454]</span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The following day Coqueville, in rising, found the
sun already high above the horizon. The air was
softer still, a drowsy sea under a clear sky, one of
those times of laziness when it is so good to do nothing.
It was a Wednesday. Until breakfast time,
Coqueville rested from the fête of the previous evening.
Then they went down to the beach to see.</p>

<p>That Wednesday the fish, the Widow Dufeu, M.
Mouchel, all were forgotten. La Queue and Rouget
did not even speak of visiting their jambins.
Toward three o'clock they sighted some casks. Four
of them were dancing before the village. The "Zéphir"
and the "Baleine" went in chase; but as there was
enough for all, they disputed no longer. Each boat
had its share. At six o'clock, after having swept all
over the little gulf, Rouget and La Queue came in,
each with three casks. And the fête began again.
The women had brought down tables for convenience.
They had brought benches as well; they set up two
cafés in the open air, such as they had at Grandport.
The Mahés were on the left; the Floches on the right,
still separated by a bar of sand. Nevertheless, that
evening the Emperor, who went from one group to the
other, carried his glasses full, so as to give every one
a taste of the six casks. At about nine o'clock they
were much gayer than the night before. The next day
Coqueville could never remember how it had gone
to bed.</p>

<p>Thursday the "Zéphir" and the "Baleine" caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1455">[Pg 1455]</span>
but four casks, two each, but they were enormous.
Friday the fishing was superb, undreamed of; there
were seven casks, three for Rouget and four for La
Queue. Coqueville was entering upon a golden age.
They never did anything any more. The fishermen,
working off the alcohol of the night before, slept till
noon. Then they strolled down to the beach and interrogated
the sea. Their sole anxiety was to know
what liquor the sea was going to bring them. They
waited there for hours, their eyes strained; they raised
shouts of joy when wreckage appeared.</p>

<p>The women and the children, from the tops of the
rocks, pointed with sweeping gestures even to the least
bunch of seaweed rolled in by the waves. And, at all
hours, the "Zéphir" and the "Baleine" stood ready to
leave. They put out, they beat the gulf, they fished
for casks, as they had fished for tun; disdaining now
the tame mackerel who capered about in the sun, and
the lazy sole rocked on the foam of the water. Coqueville
watched the fishing, dying of laughter on the
sands. Then in the evening they drank the catch.</p>

<p>That which enraptured Coqueville was that the
casks did not cease. When there were no more, there
were still more! The ship that had been lost must
truly have had a pretty cargo aboard; and Coqueville
became egoist and merry, joked over the wrecked ship,
a regular wine-cellar, enough to intoxicate all the fish
of the ocean. Added to that, never did they catch two
casks alike; they were of all shapes, of all sizes, of
all colors. Then, in every cask there was a different
liquor. So the Emperor was plunged into profound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1456">[Pg 1456]</span>
reveries; he who had drunk everything, he could identify
nothing any more. La Queue declared that never
had he seen such a cargo. The Abbé Radiguet guessed
it was an order from some savage king, wishing to
set up his wine-cellar. Coqueville, rocked in mysterious
intoxication, no longer tried to understand.</p>

<p>The ladies preferred the "creams"; they had cream
of moka, of cacao, of mint, of vanilla. Marie Rouget
drank one night so much anisette that she was sick.</p>

<p>Margot and the other young ladies tapped the
curaçao, the benedictine, the trappistine, the chartreuse.
As to the cassis, it was reserved for the little children.
Naturally the men rejoiced more when they caught
cognacs, rums, gins, everything that burned the mouth.
Then surprises produced themselves. A cask of raki
of Chio, flavored with mastic, stupefied Coqueville,
which thought that it had fallen on a cask of essence
of turpentine. All the same they drank it, for they
must lose nothing; but they talked about it for a long
time. Arrack from Batavia, Swedish eau-de-vie with
cumin, tuica calugaresca from Rumania, slivowitz
from Servia, all equally overturned every idea that
Coqueville had of what one should endure. At heart
they had a weakness for kümmel and kirschwasser,
for liqueurs as pale as water and stiff enough to kill
a man.</p>

<p>Heavens! was it possible so many good things had
been invented! At Coqueville they had known nothing
but eau-de-vie; and, moreover, not every one at
that. So their imaginations finished in exultation;
they arrived at a state of veritable worship, in face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1457">[Pg 1457]</span>
that inexhaustible variety, for that which intoxicates.
Oh! to get drunk every night on something new, on
something one does not even know the name of! It
seemed like a fairy-tale, a rain, a fountain, that would
spout extraordinary liquids, all the distilled alcohols,
perfumed with all the flowers and all the fruits of
creation.</p>

<p>So then, Friday evening, there were seven casks on
the beach! Coqueville did not leave the beach. They
lived there, thanks to the mildness of the season.
Never in September had they enjoyed so fine a week.
The fête had lasted since Monday, and there was no
reason why it should not last forever if Providence
should continue to send them casks; for the Abbé
Radiguet saw therein the hand of Providence. All
business was suspended; what use drudging when
pleasure came to them in their sleep? They were all
bourgeois, bourgeois who were drinking expensive
liquors without having to pay anything at the café.
With hands in pocket, Coqueville, basked in the sunshine
waiting for the evening's spree. Moreover, it
did not sober up; it enjoyed side by side the gaieties of
kümmel, of kirschwasser, of ratafia; in seven days
they knew the wraths of gin, the tendernesses of
curaçao, the laughter of cognac. And Coqueville remained
as innocent as a new-born child, knowing
nothing about anything, drinking with conviction that
which the good Lord sent them.</p>

<p>It was on Friday that the Mahés and the Floches
fraternized. They were very jolly that evening. Already,
the evening before, distances had drawn nearer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1458">[Pg 1458]</span>
the most intoxicated had trodden down the bar of sand
which separated the two groups. There remained but
one step to take. On the side of the Floches the four
casks were emptying, while the Mahés were equally
finishing their three little barrels; just three liqueurs
which made the French flag; one blue, one white, and
one red. The blue filled the Floches with jealousy,
because a blue liqueur seemed to them something really
supernatural. La Queue, grown good-natured now
ever since he had been drunk, advanced, a glass in his
hand, feeling that he ought to take the first step as
magistrate.</p>

<p>"See here, Rouget," he stuttered, "will you drink
with me?"</p>

<p>"Willingly," replied Rouget, who was staggering
under a feeling of tenderness.</p>

<p>And they fell upon each other's necks. Then they
all wept, so great was their emotion. The Mahés and
the Floches embraced, they who had been devouring
one another for three centuries. The Abbé Radiguet,
greatly touched, again spoke of the finger of God.
They drank to each other in the three liqueurs, the
blue, the white, and the red.</p>

<p>"<em>Vive la France!</em>" cried the Emperor.</p>

<p>The blue was worthless, the white of not much account,
but the red was really a success. Then they
tapped the casks of the Floches. Then they danced.
As there was no band, some good-natured boys clapped
their hands, whistling, which excited the girls. The
fête became superb. The seven casks were placed in
a row; each could choose that which he liked best.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1459">[Pg 1459]</span>
Those who had had enough stretched themselves out
on the sands, where they slept for a while; and when
they awoke they began again. Little by little the others
spread the fun until they took up the whole beach.
Right up to midnight they skipped in the open air.
The sea had a soft sound, the stars shone in a deep
sky, a sky of vast peace. It was the serenity of the
infant ages enveloping the joy of a tribe of savages,
intoxicated by their first cask of eau-de-vie.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Coqueville went home to bed again.
When there was nothing more left to drink, the
Floches and the Mahés helped one another, carried
one another, and ended by finding their beds again
one way or another. On Saturday the fête lasted until
nearly two o'clock in the morning. They had caught
six casks, two of them enormous. Fouasse and Tupain
almost fought. Tupain, who was wicked when drunk,
talked of finishing his brother. But that quarrel disgusted
every one, the Floches as well as the Mahés.
Was it reasonable to keep on quarreling when the
whole village was embracing? They forced the two
brothers to drink together. They were sulky. The
Emperor promised to watch them. Neither did the
Rouget household get on well. When Marie had taken
anisette she was prodigal in her attentions to Brisemotte,
which Rouget could not behold with a calm
eye, especially since having become sensitive, he also
wished to be loved. The Abbé Radiguet, full of forbearance,
did well in preaching forgiveness of injuries;
they feared an accident.</p>

<p>"Bah!" said La Queue; "all will arrange itself. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1460">[Pg 1460]</span>
the fishing is good to-morrow, you will see—Your
health!"</p>

<p>However, La Queue himself was not yet perfect.
He still kept his eye on Delphin and leveled kicks at
him whenever he saw him approach Margot. The
Emperor was indignant, for there was no common
sense in preventing two young people from laughing.
But La Queue always swore to kill his daughter sooner
than give her to "the little one." Moreover, Margot
would not be willing.</p>

<p>"Isn't it so? You are too proud," he cried. "Never
would you marry a ragamuffin!"</p>

<p>"Never, papa!" answered Margot.</p>

<p>Saturday, Margot drank a great deal of sugary
liqueur. No one had any idea of such sugar. As she
was no longer on her guard, she soon found herself
sitting close to the cask. She laughed, happy, in paradise;
she saw stars, and it seemed to her that there was
music within her, playing dance tunes. Then it was
that Delphin slipped into the shadow of the casks. He
took her hand; he asked: "Say, Margot, will you?"</p>

<p>She kept on smiling. Then she replied: "It is papa
who will not."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's nothing," said the little one; "you know
the old ones never will—provided you are willing,
you." And he grew bold, he planted a kiss on her
neck. She bridled; shivers ran along her shoulders.
"Stop! You tickle me."</p>

<p>But she talked no more of giving him a slap. In
the first place, she was not able to, for her hands were
too weak. Then it seemed nice to her, those little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1461">[Pg 1461]</span>
kisses on the neck. It was like the liqueur that enervated
her so deliciously. She ended by turning her
head and extending her chin, just like a cat.</p>

<p>"There!" she stammered, "there under the ear—that
tickles me. Oh! that is nice!"</p>

<p>They had both forgotten La Queue. Fortunately
the Emperor was on guard. He pointed them out to
the Abbé.</p>

<p>"Look there, Curé—it would be better to marry
them."</p>

<p>"Morals would gain thereby," declared the priest
sententiously.</p>

<p>And he charged himself with the matter for the
morrow. 'Twas he himself that would speak to La
Queue. Meanwhile La Queue had drunk so much
that the Emperor and the Curé were forced to
carry him home. On the way they tried to reason
with him on the subject of his daughter; but they
could draw from him nothing but growls. Behind
them, in the untroubled night, Delphin led Margot
home.</p>

<p>The next day by four o'clock the "Zéphir" and the
"Baleine" had already caught seven casks. At six
o'clock the "Zéphir" caught two more. That made
nine.</p>

<p>Then Coqueville fêted Sunday. It was the seventh
day that it had been drunk. And the fête was
complete—a fête such as no one had ever seen, and
which no one will ever see again. Speak of it in
Lower Normandy, and they will tell you with laughter,
"Ah! yes, the fête at Coqueville!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1462">[Pg 1462]</span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>In the mean while, since the Tuesday, M. Mouchel
had been surprised at not seeing either Rouget or La
Queue arrive at Grandport. What the devil could
those fellows be doing? The sea was fine, the fishing
ought to be splendid. Very possibly they wished to
bring a whole load of soles and lobsters in all at once.
And he was patient until the Wednesday.</p>

<p>Wednesday, M. Mouchel was angry. You must
know that the Widow Dufeu was not a commodious
person. She was a woman who in a flash came to high
words. Although he was a handsome fellow, blond
and powerful, he trembled before her, especially since
he had dreams of marrying her, always with little
attentions, free to subdue her with a slap if he ever
became her master. Well, that Wednesday morning
the Widow Dufeu stormed, complaining that the bundles
were no longer forwarded, that the sea failed;
and she accused him of running after the girls of the
coast instead of busying himself with the whiting and
the mackerel which ought to be yielding in abundance.
M. Mouchel, vexed, fell back on Coqueville's singular
breach of honor. For a moment surprise calmed the
Widow Dufeu. What was Coqueville dreaming about?
Never had it so conducted itself before. But she declared
immediately that she had nothing to do with
Coqueville; that it was M. Mouchel's business to look
into matters, that she should take a partner if he allowed
himself to be played with again by the fishermen.
In a word, much disquieted, he sent Rouget and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1463">[Pg 1463]</span>
La Queue to the devil. Perhaps, after all, they would
come to-morrow.</p>

<p>The next day, Thursday, neither the one nor the
other appeared. Toward evening, M. Mouchel, desperate,
climbed the rock to the left of Grandport, from
which one could see in the distance Coqueville, with
its yellow spot of beach. He gazed at it a long time.
The village had a tranquil look in the sun, light smoke
was rising from the chimneys; no doubt the women
were preparing the soup. M. Mouchel was satisfied
that Coqueville was still in its place, that a rock from
the cliff had not crushed it, and he understood less
and less. As he was about to descend again, he
thought he could make out two black points on the
gulf; the "Baleine" and the "Zéphir." After that he
went back to calm the Widow Dufeu. Coqueville was
fishing. The night passed. Friday was here. Still
nothing of Coqueville. M. Mouchel climbed to his
rock more than ten times. He was beginning to lose
his head; the Widow Dufeu behaved abominably to
him, without his finding anything to reply. Coqueville
was always there, in the sun, warming itself like a
lazy lizard. Only, M. Mouchel saw no more smoke.
The village seemed dead. Had they all died in their
holes? On the beach, there was quite a movement,
but that might be seaweed rocked by the tide. Saturday,
still no one. The Widow Dufeu scolded no more;
her eyes were fixed, her lips white. M. Mouchel
passed two hours on the rock. A curiosity grew in
him, a purely personal need of accounting to himself
for the strange immobility of the village. The old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1464">[Pg 1464]</span>
walls sleeping beatifically in the sun ended by worrying
him. His resolution was taken; he would set
out that Monday very early in the morning and try to
get down there near nine o'clock.</p>

<p>It was not a promenade to go to Coqueville. M.
Mouchel preferred to follow the route by land, in that
way he would come upon the village without their
expecting him. A wagon carried him as far as Robineux,
where he left it under a shed, for it would
not have been prudent to risk it in the middle of the
gorge. And he set off bravely, having to make nearly
seven kilometers over the most abominable of roads.
The route was otherwise of a wild beauty; it descended
by continual turns between two enormous ledges of
rock, so narrow in places that three men could not
walk abreast. Farther on it skirted the precipices;
the gorge opened abruptly; and one caught glimpses
of the sea, of immense blue horizons. But M. Mouchel
was not in a state of mind to admire the landscape.
He swore as the pebbles rolled under his feet.
It was the fault of Coqueville, he promised to shake
up those do-nothings well. But, in the meantime, he
was approaching. All at once, in the turning at the
last rock, he saw the twenty houses of the village
hanging to the flank of the cliff.</p>

<p>Nine o'clock struck. One would have believed it
June, so blue and warm was the sky; a superb season,
limpid air, gilded by the dust of the sun, refreshed by
the good smell of the sea. M. Mouchel entered the
only street of the village, where he came very often;
and as he passed before Rouget's house, he went in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1465">[Pg 1465]</span>
The house was empty. Then he cast his eye toward
Fouasse's—Tupain's—Brisemotte's. Not a soul; all
the doors open, and no one in the rooms. What did
it mean? A light chill began to creep over his flesh.
Then he thought of the authorities. Certainly, the
Emperor would reassure him. But the Emperor's
house was empty like the others. Even to the <em>garde
champêtre</em>, there was failure! That village, silent and
deserted, terrified him now. He ran to the Mayor's.
There another surprise awaited him: the house was
found in an abominable mess; they had not made the
beds in three days; dirty dishes littered the place;
chairs seemed to indicate a fight. His mind upset,
dreaming of cataclysms, M. Mouchel determined to
go on to the end, and he entered the church. No more
curé than mayor. All the authorities, even religion
itself had vanished. Coqueville abandoned, slept without
a breath, without a dog, without a cat. Not even
a fowl; the hens had taken themselves off. Nothing,
a void, silence, a leaden sleep under the great blue sky.</p>

<p>Parbleu! It was no wonder that Coqueville brought
no more fish! Coqueville had moved away. Coqueville
was dead. He must notify the police. The
mysterious catastrophe exalted M. Mouchel, when,
with the idea of descending to the beach, he uttered
a cry. In the midst of the sands, the whole population
lay stretched. He thought of a general massacre.
But the sonorous snores came to undeceive him.
During the night of Sunday Coqueville had feasted
so late that it had found itself in absolute inability to
go home to bed. So it had slept on the sand, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1466">[Pg 1466]</span>
where it had fallen, around the nine casks, completely
empty.</p>

<p>Yes, all Coqueville was snoring there; I hear the
children, the women, the old people, and the men. Not
one was on his feet. There were some on their stomachs,
there were some on their backs; others held
themselves <em>en chien de fusils</em>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> As one makes his bed
so must one lie on it. And the fellows found themselves,
happen what may, scattered in their drunkenness
like a handful of leaves driven by the wind. The
men had rolled over, heads lower than heels. It was
a scene full of good-fellowship; a dormitory in the
open air; honest family folk taking their ease; for
where there is care, there is no pleasure.</p>

<p>It was just at the new moon. Coqueville, thinking
it had blown out its candle, had abandoned itself to
the darkness. Then the day dawned; and now the sun
was flaming, a sun which fell perpendicularly on the
sleepers, powerless to make them open their eyelids.
They slept rudely, all their faces beaming with the fine
innocence of drunkards. The hens at early morning
must have strayed down to peck at the casks, for they
were drunk; they, too, sleeping on the sands. There
were also five cats and five dogs, their paws in the air,
drunk from licking the glasses glistening with sugar.</p>

<p>For a moment M. Mouchel walked about among the
sleepers, taking care not to step on any of them. He
understood, for at Grandport they, too, had received
casks from the wreck of the English ship. All his
wrath left him. What a touching and moral spectacle!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1467">[Pg 1467]</span></p>
<p>Coqueville reconciled, the Mahés and the Floches
sleeping together! With the last glass the deadliest
enemies had embraced. Tupain and Fouasse lay there
snoring, hand in hand, like brothers, incapable of coming
to dispute a legacy. As to the Rouget household,
it offered a still more amiable picture, Marie slept between
Rouget and Brisemotte, as much as to say that
henceforth they were to live thus, happy, all the three.</p>

<p>But one group especially exhibited a scene of family
tenderness. It was Delphin and Margot; one on
the neck of the other, they slept cheek to cheek, their
lips still opened for a kiss. At their feet the Emperor,
sleeping crosswise, guarded them. Above them La
Queue snored like a father satisfied at having settled
his daughter, while the Abbé Radiguet, fallen there
like the others, with arms outspread, seemed to bless
them. In her sleep Margot still extended her rosy
muzzle like an amorous cat who loves to have one
scratch her under the chin.</p>

<p>The fête ended with a marriage. And M. Mouchel
himself later married the Widow Dufeu, whom he
beat to a jelly. Speak of that in Lower Normandy,
they will tell you with a laugh, "Ah! yes, the fête at
Coqueville!"</p>

<p><em>François Coppée, Poet of the Humble, was
born at Paris in 1842. His first collection of
poems was called "Le Reliquaire," 1866, and
already exhibited to an astonishing degree the
full equipment of a poet, much as Keats did
in his first work. But Coppée's great reputation
began to grow from the date of "Passant,"
1869, exquisite comedies in verse, and "Le Luthier
de Crèmone," an agreeable and touching

<p>On that morning, which was the morning before
Christmas, two important events happened
simultaneously—the sun rose, and so
did M. Jean-Baptiste Godefroy.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the sun, illuminating suddenly the
whole of Paris with its morning rays, is an old friend,
regarded with affection by everybody. It is particularly
welcome after a fortnight of misty atmosphere
and gray skies, when the wind has cleared the air and
allowed the sun's rays to reach the earth again. Besides
all of which the sun is a person of importance.
Formerly, he was regarded as a god, and was called
Osiris, Apollyon, and I don't know what else. But
do not imagine that because the sun is so important
he is of greater influence than M. Jean-Baptiste Godefroy,
millionaire banker, director of the <em>Comptoir Général
de Crédit</em>, administrator of several big companies,
deputy and member of the General Counsel of the
Eure, officer of the Legion of Honor, etc., etc. And
whatever opinion the sun may have about himself, he
certainly has not a higher opinion than M. Jean-Baptiste
Godefroy has of <em>himself</em>. So we are authorized
to state, and we consider ourselves justified in
stating, that on the morning in question, at about a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1472">[Pg 1472]</span>quarter to eight, the sun and M. Jean-Baptiste Godefroy
rose.</p>

<p>Certainly the manner of rising of these two great
powers mentioned was not the same. The good old
sun began by doing a great many pretty actions. As
the sleet had, during the night, covered the bare
branches of the trees in the boulevard Malesherbes,
where the <em>hôtel</em> Godefroy is situated, with a powdered
coating, the great magician sun amused himself by
transforming the branches into great bouquets of red
coral. At the same time he scattered his rays impartially
on those poor passers-by whom necessity sent
out, so early in the morning, to gain their daily bread.
He even had a smile for the poor clerk, who, in a
thin overcoat, was hurrying to his office, as well as
for the <em>grisette</em>, shivering under her thin, insufficient
clothing; for the workman carrying half a loaf under
his arm, for the car-conductor as he punched the
tickets, and for the dealer in roast chestnuts, who
was roasting his first panful. In short, the sun gave
pleasure to everybody in the world. M. Jean-Baptiste
Godefroy, on the contrary, rose in quite a different
frame of mind. On the previous evening he had
dined with the Minister for Agriculture. The dinner,
from the removal of the <em>potage</em> to the salad, bristled
with truffles, and the banker's stomach, aged forty-seven
years, experienced the burning and biting of
pyrosis. So the manner in which M. Jean-Baptiste
Godefroy rang for his valet-de-chambre was so expressive
that, as he got some warm water for his master's
shaving, Charles said to the kitchen-maid:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1473">[Pg 1473]</span></p>

<p>"There he goes! The monkey is barbarously ill-tempered
again this morning. My poor Gertrude,
we're going to have a miserable day."</p>

<p>Whereupon, walking on tiptoe, with eyes modestly
cast down, he entered the chamber of his master,
opened the curtains, lit the fire, and made all the
necessary preparations for the toilet with the discreet
demeanor and respectful gestures of a sacristan placing
the sacred vessels on the altar for the priest.</p>

<p>"What sort of weather this morning?" demanded
M. Godefroy curtly, as he buttoned his undervest of
gray swandown upon a stomach that was already a
little too prominent.</p>

<p>"Very cold, sir," replied Charles meekly. "At six
o'clock the thermometer marked seven degrees above
zero. But, as you will see, sir, the sky is quite clear,
and I think we are going to have a fine morning."</p>

<p>In stropping his razor, M. Godefroy approached the
window, drew aside one of the hangings, looked on
the boulevard, which was bathed in brightness, and
made a slight grimace which bore some resemblance
to a smile.</p>

<p>It is all very well to be perfectly stiff and correct,
and to know that it is bad taste to show feeling of any
kind in the presence of domestics, but the appearance
of the roguish sun in the middle of December sends
such a glow of warmth to the heart that it is impossible
to disguise the fact. So M. Godefroy deigned,
as before observed, to smile. If some one had whispered
to the opulent banker that his smile had anything
in common with that of the printer's boy, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1474">[Pg 1474]</span>
was enjoying himself by making a slide on the pavement,
M. Godefroy would have been highly incensed.
But it really was so all the same; and during the space
of one minute this man, who was so occupied by business
matters, this leading light in the financial and
political worlds, indulged in the childish pastime of
watching the passers-by, and following with his eyes
the files of conveyances as they gaily rolled in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>But pray do not be alarmed. Such a weakness could
not last long. People of no account, and those who
have nothing to do, may be able to let their time slip
by in doing nothing. It is very well for women, children,
poets, and riffraff. M. Godefroy had other fish
to fry; and the work of the day which was commencing
promised to be exceptionally heavy. From half-past
eight to ten o'clock he had a meeting at his office with
a certain number of gentlemen, all of whom bore a
striking resemblance to M. Godefroy. Like him, they
were very nervous; they had risen with the sun, they
were all <em>blasés</em>, and they all had the same object in
view—to gain money. After breakfast (which he took
after the meeting), M. Godefroy had to leap into his
carriage and rush to the Bourse, to exchange a few
words with other gentlemen who had also risen at
dawn, but who had not the least spark of imagination
among them. (The conversations were always on the
same subject—money.) From there, without losing
an instant, M. Godefroy went to preside over another
meeting of acquaintances entirely void of compassion
and tenderness. The meeting was held round a baize-covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1475">[Pg 1475]</span>
table, which was strewn with heaps of papers
and well provided with ink-wells. The conversation
again turned on money, and various methods of gaining
it. After the aforesaid meeting he, in his capacity
of deputy, had to appear before several commissions
(always held in rooms where there were baize-covered
tables and ink-wells and heaps of papers). There he
found men as devoid of sentiment as he was, all utterly
incapable of neglecting any occasion of gaining money,
but who, nevertheless, had the extreme goodness to
sacrifice several hours of the afternoon to the glory of
France.</p>

<p>After having quickly shaved he donned a morning
suit, the elegant cut and finish of which showed that
the old beau of nearly fifty had not ceased trying to
please. When he shaved he spared the narrow strip
of pepper-and-salt beard round his chin, as it gave him
the air of a trustworthy family man in the eyes of the
Arrogants and of fools in general. Then he descended
to his cabinet, where he received the file of men who
were entirely occupied by one thought—that of augmenting
their capital. These gentlemen discussed several
projected enterprises, all of them of considerable
importance, notably that of a new railroad to be laid
across a wild desert. Another scheme was for the
founding of monster works in the environs of Paris,
another of a mine to be worked in one of the South
American republics. It goes without saying that no
one asked if the railway would have passengers or
goods to carry, or if the proposed works should manufacture
cotton nightcaps or distil whisky; whether the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1476">[Pg 1476]</span>
mine was to be of virgin gold or of second-rate copper:
certainly not. The conversation of M. Godefroy's
morning callers turned exclusively upon the profits
which it would be possible to realize during the week
which should follow the issue of the shares. They discussed
particularly the values of the shares, which they
knew would be destined before long to be worth less
than the paper on which they were printed in fine style.</p>

<p>These conversations, bristling with figures, lasted
till ten o'clock precisely, and then the director of the
<em>Comptoir Général de Crédit</em>, who, by the way, was an
honest man—at least, as honest as is to be found in
business—courteously conducted his last visitor to the
head of the stairway. The visitor named was an old
villain, as rich as Crœsus, who, by a not uncommon
chance, enjoyed the general esteem of the public;
whereas, had justice been done to him, he would have
been lodging at the expense of the State in one of
those large establishments provided by a thoughtful
government for smaller delinquents; and there he
would have pursued a useful and healthy calling for a
lengthy period, the exact length having been fixed by
the judges of the supreme court. But M. Godefroy
showed him out relentlessly, notwithstanding his importance—it
was absolutely necessary to be at the
Bourse at 11 o'clock—and went into the dining-room.</p>

<p>It was a luxuriously furnished room. The furniture
and plate would have served to endow a cathedral.
Nevertheless, notwithstanding that M. Godefroy took
a gulp of bicarbonate of soda, his indigestion refused
to subside, consequently the banker could only take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1477">[Pg 1477]</span>
scantiest breakfast—that of a dyspeptic. In the midst
of such luxury, and under the eye of a well-paid butler,
M. Godefroy could only eat a couple of boiled eggs
and nibble a little mutton chop. The man of money
trifled with dessert—took only a crumb of Roquefort—not
more than two cents' worth. Then the door
opened and an overdressed but charming little child—young
Raoul, four years old—the son of the company
director, entered the room, accompanied by his German
nursery governess.</p>

<p>This event occurred every day at the same hour—a
quarter to eleven, precisely, while the carriage which
was to take the banker to the Bourse was awaiting
the gentleman who had only a quarter of an hour to
give to paternal sentiment. It was not that he did not
love his son. He did love him—nay, he adored him,
in his own particular way. But then, you know, business
is business.</p>

<p>At the age of forty-two, when already worldly-wise
and <em>blasé</em>, he had fancied himself in love with the
daughter of one of his club friends—Marquis de Neufontaine,
an old rascal—a nobleman, but one whose
card-playing was more than open to suspicion, and
who would have been expelled from the club more than
once but for the influence of M. Godefroy. The nobleman
was only too happy to become the father-in-law
of a man who would pay his debts, and without
any scruples he handed over his daughter—a simple
and ingenuous child of seventeen, who was taken from
a convent to be married—to the worldly banker. The
girl was certainly sweet and pretty, but she had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1478">[Pg 1478]</span>
dowry except numerous aristocratic prejudices and
romantic illusions, and her father thought he was
fortunate in getting rid of her on such favorable
terms. M. Godefroy, who was the son of an avowed
old miser of Andelys, had always remained a man of
the people, and intensely vulgar. In spite of his improved
circumstances, he had not improved. His
entire lack of tact and refinement was painful to his
young wife, whose tenderest feelings he ruthlessly and
thoughtlessly trampled upon. Things were looking
unpromising, when, happily for her, Madame Godefroy
died in giving birth to her firstborn. When he spoke
of his deceased wife, the banker waxed poetical, although
had she lived they would have been divorced in
six months. His son he loved dearly for several reasons—first,
because the child was an only son; secondly,
because he was a scion of two such houses as
Godefroy and Neufontaine; finally, because the man
of money had naturally great respect for the heir to
many millions. So the youngster had golden rattles
and other similar toys, and was brought up like a
young Dauphin. But his father, overwhelmed with
business worries, could never give the child more than
fifteen minutes per day of his precious time—and, as
on the day mentioned, it was always during "cheese"—and
for the rest of the day the father abandoned the
child to the care of the servants.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Raoul."</p>

<p>"Good morning, papa."</p>

<p>And the company director, having put his serviette
away, sat young Raoul on his left knee, took the child's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1479">[Pg 1479]</span>
head between his big paws, and in stroking and kissing
it actually forgot all his money matters and even
his note of the afternoon, which was of great importance
to him, as by it he could gain quite an important
amount of patronage.</p>

<p>"Papa," said little Raoul suddenly, "will Father
Christmas put anything in my shoe to-night?"</p>

<p>The father answered with "Yes, if you are a good
child." This was very striking from a man who was
a pronounced freethinker, who always applauded
every anti-clerical attack in the Chamber with a
vigorous "Hear, hear." He made a mental note
that he must buy some toys for his child that very
afternoon.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the nursery governess with:</p>

<p>"Are you quite satisfied with Raoul, Mademoiselle
Bertha?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Bertha became as red as a peony at
being addressed, as if the question were scarcely
<em>comme il faut</em>, and replied by a little imbecile snigger,
which seemed fully to satisfy M. Godefroy's curiosity
about his son's conduct.</p>

<p>"It's fine to-day," said the financier, "but cold. If
you take Raoul to Monceau Park, mademoiselle, please
be careful to wrap him up well."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle, by a second fit of idiotic smiling, having
set at rest M. Godefroy's doubts and fears on that
essential point, he kissed his child, left the room hastily,
and in the hall was enveloped in his fur coat by
Charles, who also closed the carriage door. Then the
faithful fellow went off to the café which he frequented,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1480">[Pg 1480]</span>
Rue de Miromesnil, where he had promised to
meet the coachman of the baroness who lived opposite,
to play a game of billiards, thirty up—and spot-barred,
of course.</p>

<p>Thanks to the brown bay—for which a thousand
francs over and above its value was paid by M. Godefroy
as a result of a sumptuous snail supper given
to that gentleman's coachman by the horse-dealer—thanks
to the expensive brown bay which certainly
went well, the financier was able to get through his
many engagements satisfactorily. He appeared punctually
at the Bourse, sat at several committee tables,
and at a quarter to five, by voting with the ministry,
he helped to reassure France and Europe that the
rumors of a ministerial crisis had been totally unfounded.
He voted with the ministry because he had
succeeded in obtaining the favors which he demanded
as the price of his vote.</p>

<p>After he had thus nobly fulfilled his duty to himself
and his country, M. Godefroy remembered what he
had said to his child on the subject of Father Christmas,
and gave his coachman the address of a dealer
in toys. There he bought, and had put in his carriage,
a fantastic rocking-horse, mounted on castors—a
whip in each ear; a box of leaden soldiers—all
as exactly alike as those grenadiers of the Russian
regiment of the time of Paul I, who all had black
hair and snub noses; and a score of other toys, all
equally striking and costly. Then, as he returned
home, softly reposing in his well-swung carriage, the
rich banker, who, after all, was a father, began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1481">[Pg 1481]</span>
think with pride of his little boy and to form plans
for his future.</p>

<p>When the child grew up he should have an education
worthy of a prince, and he would be one, too, for
there was no longer any aristocracy except that of
money, and his boy would have a capital of about
30,000,000 francs.</p>

<p>If his father, a pettifogging provincial lawyer,
who had formerly dined in the Latin Quarter when
in Paris, who had remarked every evening when
putting on a white tie that he looked as fine as if
he were going to a wedding—if he had been able
to accumulate an enormous fortune, and to become
thereby a power in the republic; if he had been able
to obtain in marriage a young lady, one of whose
ancestors had fallen at Marignan, what an important
personage little Raoul might become. M. Godefroy
built all sorts of air-castles for his boy, forgetting
that Christmas is the birthday of a very poor little
child, son of a couple of vagrants, born in a
stable, where the parents only found lodging through
charity.</p>

<p>In the midst of the banker's dreams the coachman
cried: "Door, please," and drove into the yard. As he
went up the steps M. Godefroy was thinking that he
had barely time to dress for dinner; but on entering
the vestibule he found all the domestics crowded in
front of him in a state of alarm and confusion. In a
corner, crouching on a seat, was the German nursery-governess,
crying. When she saw the banker she
buried her face in her hands and wept still more copiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1482">[Pg 1482]</span>
than before. M. Godefroy felt that some misfortune
had happened.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of all this? What's amiss?
What has happened?"</p>

<p>Charles, the <em>valet de chambre</em>, a sneaking rascal of
the worst type, looked at his master with eyes full of
pity and stammered: "Mr. Raoul—"</p>

<p>"My boy?"</p>

<p>"Lost, sir. The stupid German did it. Since four
o'clock this afternoon he has not been seen."</p>

<p>The father staggered back like one who had been
hit by a ball. The German threw herself at his feet,
screaming: "Mercy, mercy!" and the domestics all
spoke at the same time.</p>

<p>"Bertha didn't go to <em>parc Monceau</em>. She lost the
child over there on the fortifications. We have sought
him all over, sir. We went to the office for you, sir,
and then to the Chamber, but you had just left. Just
imagine, the German had a rendezvous with her lover
every day, beyond the ramparts, near the gate of
Asnières. What a shame! It is a place full of low
gipsies and strolling players. Perhaps the child has
been stolen. Yes, sir, we informed the police at once.
How could we imagine such a thing? A hypocrite,
that German! She had a rendezvous, doubtless, with
a countryman—a Prussian spy, sure enough!"</p>

<p>His son lost! M. Godefroy seemed to have a torrent
of blood rushing through his head. He sprang
at Mademoiselle, seized her by the arms and shook
her furiously.</p>

<p>"Where did you lose him, you miserable girl? Tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1483">[Pg 1483]</span>
me the truth before I shake you to pieces. Do you
hear? Do you hear?"</p>

<p>But the unfortunate girl could only cry and beg for
mercy.</p>

<p>The banker tried to be calm. No, it was impossible.
Nobody would dare to steal <em>his</em> boy. Somebody would
find him and bring him back. Of that there could be
no doubt. He could scatter money about right and
left, and could have the entire police force at his
orders. And he would set to work at once, for not
an instant should be lost.</p>

<p>"Charles, don't let the horses be taken out. You
others, see that this girl doesn't escape. I'm going to
the Prefecture."</p>

<p>And M. Godefroy, with his heart thumping against
his sides as if it would break them, his hair wild with
fright, darted into his carriage, which at once rolled
off as fast as the horses could take it. What irony!
The carriage was full of glittering playthings, which
sparkled every time a gaslight shone on them. For
the next day was the birthday of the divine Infant at
whose cradle wise men and simple shepherds alike
adored.</p>

<p>"My poor little Raoul! Poor darling! Where is
my boy?" repeated the father as in his anguish he
dug his nails into the cushions of the carriage. At
that moment all his titles and decorations, his honors,
his millions, were valueless to him. He had one single
idea burning in his brain. "My poor child! Where
is my child?"</p>

<p>At last he reached the Prefecture of Police. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1484">[Pg 1484]</span>
no one was there—the office had been deserted for
some time.</p>

<p>"I am M. Godefroy, deputy from L'Eure—My
little boy is lost in Paris; a child of four years. I
must see the Prefect."</p>

<p>He slipped a louis into the hand of the <em>concièrge</em>.</p>

<p>The good old soul, a veteran with a gray mustache,
less for the sake of the money than out of compassion
for the poor father, led him to the Prefect's private
apartments. M. Godefroy was finally ushered into
the room of the man in whom were centred all his
hopes. He was in evening dress, and wore a monocle;
his manner was frigid and rather pretentious. The
distressed father, whose knees trembled through emotion,
sank into an armchair, and, bursting into tears,
told of the loss of his boy—told the story stammeringly
and with many breaks, for his voice was choked
by sobs.</p>

<p>The Prefect, who was also father of a family, was
inwardly moved at the sight of his visitor's grief, but
he repressed his emotion and assumed a cold and self-important
air.</p>

<p>"You say, sir, that your child has been missing since
four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Just when night was falling, confound it. He
isn't at all precocious, speaks very little, doesn't know
where he lives, and can't even pronounce his own
name?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately that is so."</p>

<p>"Not far from Asnières gate? A suspected quarter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1485">[Pg 1485]</span>
But cheer up. We have a very intelligent <em>Commissaire
de Police</em> there. I'll telephone to him."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The distressed father was left alone for five
minutes. How his temples throbbed and his heart
beat!</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the Prefect reappeared, smiling
with satisfaction. "Found!"</p>

<p>Whereupon M. Godefroy rushed to the Prefect,
whose hand he pressed till that functionary winced
with the pain.</p>

<p>"I must acknowledge that we were exceedingly fortunate.
The little chap is blond, isn't he? Rather
pale? In blue velvet? Black felt hat, with a white
feather in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; that's he. That's my little Raoul."</p>

<p>"Well, he's at the house of a poor fellow down in
that quarter who had just been at the police office to
make his declaration to the Commissaire. Here's his
address, which I took down: '<em>Pierron, rue des Cailloux,
Levallois-Perret.</em>' With good horses you may reach
your boy in less than an hour. Certainly, you won't
find him in an aristocratic quarter; his surroundings
won't be of the highest. The man who found him is
only a small dealer in vegetables."</p>

<p>But that was of no importance to M. Godefroy, who,
having expressed his gratitude to the Prefect, leaped
down the stairs four at a time, and sprang into his
carriage. At that moment he realized how devotedly
he loved his child. As he drove away he no longer
thought of little Raoul's princely education and magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1486">[Pg 1486]</span>
inheritance. He was decided never again to
hand over the child entirely to the hands of servants,
and he also made up his mind to devote less time to
monetary matters and the glory of France and attend
more to his own. The thought also occurred to him
that France wouldn't be likely to suffer from the
neglect. He had hitherto been ashamed to recognize
the existence of an old-maid sister of his father, but
he decided to send for her to his house. She would
certainly shock his lackeys by her primitive manners
and ideas. But what of that? She would take care
of his boy, which to him was of much more importance
than the good opinion of his servants. The financier,
who was always in a hurry, never felt so eager to
arrive punctually at a committee meeting as he was
to reach the lost little one. For the first time in his
life he was longing through pure affection to take the
child in his arms.</p>

<p>The carriage rolled rapidly along in the clear,
crisp night air down boulevard Malesherbes; and,
having crossed the ramparts and passed the large
houses, plunged into the quiet solitude of suburban
streets. When the carriage stopped M. Godefroy saw
a wretched hovel, on which was the number he was
seeking; it was the house where Pierron lived. The
door of the house opened immediately, and a big,
rough-looking fellow with red mustache appeared.
One of his sleeves was empty. Seeing the gentleman
in the carriage, Pierron said cheerily: "So you are the
little one's father. Don't be afraid. The little darling
is quite safe," and, stepping aside in order to allow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1487">[Pg 1487]</span>
M. Godefroy to pass, he placed his finger on his lips
with: "Hush! The little one is asleep!"</p>

<p>Yes, it was a real hovel. By the dim light of a
little oil lamp M. Godefroy could just distinguish a
dresser from which a drawer was missing, some broken
chairs, a round table on which stood a beer-mug which
was half empty, three glasses, some cold meat on a
plate, and on the bare plaster of the wall two gaudy
pictures—a bird's-eye view of the Exposition of 1889,
with the Eiffel Tower in bright blue, and the portrait
of General Boulanger when a handsome young lieutenant.
This last evidence of weakness of the tenant
of the house may well be excused, since it was shared
by nearly everybody in France. The man took the
lamp and went on tiptoe to the corner of the room
where, on a clean bed, two little fellows were fast
asleep. In the little one, around whom the other
had thrown a protecting arm, M. Godefroy recognized
his son.</p>

<p>"The youngsters were tired to death, and so sleepy,"
said Pierron, trying to soften his rough voice. "I had
no idea when you would come, so gave them some
supper and put them to bed, and then I went to make
a declaration at the police office. Zidore generally
sleeps up in the garret, but I thought they would be
better here, and that I should be better able to watch
them."</p>

<p>M. Godefroy, however, scarcely heard the explanation.
Strangely moved, he looked at the two sleeping
infants on an iron bedstead and covered with an old
blanket which had once been used either in barracks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1488">[Pg 1488]</span>
or hospital. Little Raoul, who was still in his velvet
suit, looked so frail and delicate compared with his
companion that the banker almost envied the latter
his brown complexion.</p>

<p>"Is he your boy?" he asked Pierron.</p>

<p>"No," answered he. "I am a bachelor, and don't
suppose I shall ever marry, because of my accident.
You see, a dray passed over my arm—that was all.
Two years ago a neighbor of mine died, when that
child was only five years old. The poor mother really
died of starvation. She wove wreaths for the cemeteries,
but could make nothing worth mentioning at
that trade—not enough to live. However, she worked
for the child for five years, and then the neighbors
had to buy wreaths for her. So I took care of the
youngster. Oh, it was nothing much, and I was soon
repaid. He is seven years old, and is a sharp little
fellow, so he helps me a great deal. On Sundays and
Thursdays, and the other days after school, he helps
me push my handcart. Zidore is a smart little chap.
It was he who found your boy."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed M. Godefroy—"that child!"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's quite a little man, I assure you. When he
left school he found your child, who was walking on
ahead, crying like a fountain. He spoke to him and
comforted him, like an old grandfather. The difficulty
is, that one can't easily understand what your
little one says—English words are mixed up with German
and French. So we couldn't get much out of
him, nor could we learn his address. Zidore brought
him to me—I wasn't far away; and then all the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1489">[Pg 1489]</span>
women in the place came round chattering and croaking
like so many frogs, and all full of advice.</p>

<p>"'Take him to the police,'" said some.</p>

<p>But Zidore protested.</p>

<p>"That would scare him," said he, for like all
Parisians, he has no particular liking for the police—"and
besides, your little one didn't wish to leave
him. So I came back here with the child as soon as
I could. They had supper, and then off to bed.
Don't they look sweet?"</p>

<p>When he was in his carriage, M. Godefroy had decided
to reward the finder of his child handsomely—to
give him a handful of that gold so easily gained.
Since entering the house he had seen a side of human
nature with which he was formerly unacquainted—the
brave charity of the poor in their misery. The courage
of the poor girl who had worked herself to death
weaving wreaths to keep her child; the generosity of
the poor cripple in adopting the orphan, and above all,
the intelligent goodness of the little street Arab in protecting
the child who was still smaller than himself—all
this touched M. Godefroy deeply and set him reflecting.
For the thought had occurred to him that
there were other cripples who needed to be looked
after as well as Pierron, and other orphans as well as
Zidore. He also debated whether it would not be better
to employ his time looking after them, and whether
money might not be put to a better use than merely
gaining money. Such was his reverie as he stood
looking at the two sleeping children. Finally, he
turned round to study the features of the greengrocer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1490">[Pg 1490]</span>
and was charmed by the loyal expression in the face
of the man, and his clear, truthful eyes.</p>

<p>"My friend," said M. Godefroy, "you and your
adopted son have rendered me an immense service. I
shall soon prove to you that I am not ungrateful.
But, for to-day—I see that you are not in comfortable
circumstances, and I should like to leave a small proof
of my thankfulness."</p>

<p>But the hand of the cripple arrested that of the
banker, which was diving into his coat-pocket where
he kept bank-notes.</p>

<p>"No, sir; no! Anybody else would have done just as
we have done. I will not accept any recompense; but
pray don't take offense. Certainly, I am not rolling
in wealth, but please excuse my pride—that of an old
soldier; I have the Tonquin medal—and I don't wish
to eat food which I haven't earned."</p>

<p>"As you like," said the financier; "but an old soldier
like you is capable of something better. You are
too good to push a handcart. I will make some arrangement
for you, never fear."</p>

<p>The cripple responded by a quiet smile, and said
coldly: "Well, sir, if you really wish to do something
for me—"</p>

<p>"You'll let me care for Zidore, won't you?" cried
M. Godefroy, eagerly.</p>

<p>"That I will, with the greatest of pleasure," responded
Pierron, joyfully. "I have often thought
about the child's future. He is a sharp little fellow.
His teachers are delighted with him."</p>

<p>Then Pierron suddenly stopped, and an expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1491">[Pg 1491]</span>
came over his face which M. Godefroy at once interpreted
as one of distrust. The thought evidently was:
"Oh, when he has once left us he'll forget us entirely."</p>

<p>"You can safely pick the child up in your arms and
take him to the carriage. He'll be better at home than
here, of course. Oh, you needn't be afraid of disturbing
him. He is fast asleep, and you can just pick him
up. He must have his shoes on first, though."</p>

<p>Following Pierron's glance M. Godefroy perceived
on the hearth, where a scanty coke fire was dying out,
two pairs of children's shoes—the elegant ones of
Raoul, and the rough ones of Zidore. Each pair contained
a little toy and a package of bonbons.</p>

<p>"Don't think about that," said Pierron in an abashed
tone. "Zidore put the shoes there. You know children
still believe in Christmas and the child Jesus,
whatever scholars may say about fables; so, as I came
back from the <em>commissaire</em>, as I didn't know whether
your boy would have to stay here to-night, I got those
things for them both."</p>

<p>At which the eyes of M. Godefroy, the freethinker,
the hardened capitalist, and <em>blasé</em> man of the world,
filled with tears.</p>

<p>He rushed out of the house, but returned in a minute
with his arms full of the superb mechanical horse,
the box of leaden soldiers, and the rest of the costly
playthings bought by him in the afternoon, and which
had not even been taken out of the carriage.</p>

<p>"My friend, my dear friend," said he to the greengrocer,
"see, these are the presents which Christmas
has brought to my little Raoul. I want him to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1492">[Pg 1492]</span>
them here, when he awakens, and to share them with
Zidore, who will henceforth be his playmate and
friend. You'll trust me now, won't you? I'll take
care both of Zidore and of you, and then I shall ever
remain in your debt, for not only have you found my
boy, but you have also reminded me, who am rich and
lived only for myself, that there are other poor who
need to be looked after. I swear by these two sleeping
children, I won't forget them any longer."</p>

<p>Such is the miracle which happened on the 24th of
December of last year, ladies and gentlemen, at Paris,
in the full flow of modern egotism. It doesn't sound
likely—that I own; and I am compelled to attribute
this miraculous event to the influence of the Divine
Child who came down to earth nearly nineteen centuries
ago to command men to love one another.</p>

<p><em>The gentle Anatole France, with "vast learning
worn with an almost mocking air," conserver
of pure, unaffected French, chief of the
school inaugurating the sociological novel, the

Since his first attempt at verse, he has written
only in prose, "The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard,"

literature and winning a crown from the Academy.
Besides "Thäis," a masterpiece of color

contemporary criticism and history—but in all
he writes he figures forth the soul of Anatole
France, a complex, subtle soul of varied moods,
attached to no religion, with sympathy for all.
His style, pure as spring water, is flavored with

<h3>I</h3>

<p>This garden of our childhood, said Monsieur
Bergeret, this garden that one could pace
off in twenty steps, was for us a whole world,
full of smiles and surprises.</p>

<p>"Lucien, do you recall Putois?" asked Zoe, smiling
as usual, the lips pressed, bending over her work.</p>

<p>"Do I recall Putois! Of all the faces I saw as a
child that of Putois remains the clearest in my remembrance.
All the features of his face and his
character are fixed in my mind. He had a pointed
cranium...."</p>

<p>"A low forehead," added Mademoiselle Zoe.</p>

<p>And the brother and sister recited alternately, in a
monotonous voice, with an odd gravity, the points
in a sort of description:</p>

<p>"A low forehead."</p>

<p>"Squinting eyes."</p>

<p>"A shifty glance."</p>

<p>"Crow's-feet at the temples."</p>

<p>"The cheek-bones sharp, red and shining."</p>

<p>"His ears had no rims to them."</p>

<p>"The features were devoid of all expression."</p>

<p>"His hands, which were never still, alone expressed
his meaning."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1496">[Pg 1496]</span></p>
<p>"Thin, somewhat bent, feeble in appearance...."</p>

<p>"In reality he was unusually strong."</p>

<p>"He easily bent a five-franc piece between the first
finger and the thumb...."</p>

<p>"Which was enormous."</p>

<p>"His voice was drawling...."</p>

<p>"And his speech mild."</p>

<p>Suddenly Monsieur Bergeret exclaimed: "Zoe! we
have forgotten 'Yellow hair and sparse beard.' Let
us begin all over again."</p>

<p>Pauline, who had listened with astonishment to this
strange recital, asked her father and aunt how they
had been able to learn by heart this bit of prose, and
why they recited it as if it were a litany.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bergeret gravely answered:</p>

<p>"Pauline, what you have heard is a text, I may say a
liturgy, used by the Bergeret family. It should be
handed down to you so that it may not perish with your
aunt and me. Your grandfather, my daughter, your
grandfather, Eloi Bergeret, who was not amused with
trifles, thought highly of this bit, principally because of
its origin. He called it 'The Anatomy of Putois.' And
he used to say that he preferred, in certain respects,
the anatomy of Putois to the anatomy of Quaresmeprenant.
'If the description by Xenomanes,' he said,
'is more learned and richer in unusual and choice expressions,
the description of Putois greatly surpasses
it in clarity and simplicity of style.' He held this opinion
because Doctor Ledouble, of Tours, had not yet
explained chapters thirty, thirty-one, and thirty-two of
the fourth book of Rabelais."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1497">[Pg 1497]</span></p>

<p>"I do not understand at all," said Pauline.</p>

<p>"That is because you did not know Putois, my daughter.
You must understand that Putois was the most
familiar figure in my childhood and in that of your
Aunt Zoe. In the house of your grandfather Bergeret
we constantly spoke of Putois. Each believed that he
had seen him."</p>

<p>Pauline asked:</p>

<p>"Who was this Putois?"</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Monsieur Bergeret commenced
to laugh, and Mademoiselle Bergeret also laughed,
her lips pressed tight together. Pauline looked from
one to the other. She thought it strange that her
aunt should laugh so heartily, and more strange that
she should laugh with and in sympathy with her
brother. It was indeed singular, as the brother and
sister were quite different in character.</p>

<p>"Papa, tell me what was Putois? Since you wish
me to know, tell me."</p>

<p>"Putois, my daughter, was a gardener. The son
of honest market-gardeners, he set up for himself as
nurseryman at Saint-Omer. But he did not satisfy his
customers and got in a bad way. Having given up
business, he went out by the day. Those who employed
him could not always congratulate themselves."</p>

<p>At this, Mademoiselle Bergeret, laughing, rejoined:</p>

<p>"Do you recall, Lucien, when our father could not
find his ink, his pens, his sealing-wax, his scissors, he
said: 'I suspect Putois has been here'?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Monsieur Bergeret, "Putois had not a
good reputation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1498">[Pg 1498]</span></p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Pauline.</p>

<p>"No, my daughter, it is not all. Putois was remarkable
in this, that while we knew him and were familiar
with him, nevertheless—"</p>

<p>"—He did not exist," said Zoe.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bergeret looked at his sister with an air
of reproach.</p>

<p>"What a speech, Zoe! and why break the charm
like that? Do you dare say it, Zoe? Zoe, can you
prove it? To maintain that Putois did not exist,
that Putois never was, have you sufficiently considered
the conditions of existence and the modes of being?
Putois existed, my sister. But it is true that his was a
peculiar existence."</p>

<p>"I understand less and less," said Pauline, discouraged.</p>

<p>"The truth will be clear to you presently, my daughter.
Know then that Putois was born fully grown. I
was still a child and your aunt was a little girl. We
lived in a little house, in a suburb of Saint-Omer. Our
parents led a peaceful, retired life, until they were discovered
by an old lady named Madame Cornouiller,
who lived at the manor of Montplaisir, twelve miles
from town, and proved to be a great-aunt of my
mother's. By right of relationship she insisted that
our father and mother come to dine every Sunday at
Montplaisir, where they were excessively bored. She
said that it was the proper thing to have a family
dinner on Sunday and that only people of common
origin failed to observe this ancient custom. My
father was bored to the point of tears at Montplaisir.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1499">[Pg 1499]</span>
His desperation was painful to contemplate. But
Madame Cornouiller did not notice it. She saw nothing.
My mother was braver. She suffered as much
as my father, and perhaps more, but she smiled."</p>

<p>"Women are made to suffer," said Zoe.</p>

<p>"Zoe, every living thing is destined to suffer. In
vain our parents refused these fatal invitations. Madame
Cornouiller came to take them each Sunday
afternoon. They had to go to Montplaisir; it was an
obligation from which there was absolutely no escape.
It was an established order that only a revolt could
break. My father finally revolted and swore not to
accept another invitation from Madame Cornouiller,
leaving it to my mother to find decent pretexts and
varied reasons for these refusals, for which she was
the least capable. Our mother did not know how to
pretend."</p>

<p>"Say, Lucien, that she did not like to. She could
tell a fib as well as any one."</p>

<p>"It is true that when she had good reasons she gave
them rather than invent poor ones. Do you recall, my
sister, that one day she said at table: 'Fortunately,
Zoe has the whooping-cough; we shall not have to go
to Montplaisir for some time'?"</p>

<p>"That was true!" said Zoe.</p>

<p>"You got over it, Zoe. And one day Madame Cornouiller
said to my mother: 'Dearest, I count on your
coming with your husband to dine Sunday at Montplaisir.'
Our mother, expressly bidden by her husband
to give Madame Cornouiller a good reason for
declining, invented, in this extremity, a reason that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1500">[Pg 1500]</span>
was not the truth. 'I am extremely sorry, dear Madame,
but that will be impossible for us. Sunday I
expect the gardener.'</p>

<p>"On hearing this, Madame Cornouiller looked
through the glass door of the salon at the little wild
garden, where the prickwood and the lilies looked as
though they had never known the pruning-knife and
were likely never to know it. 'You expect the gardener!
What for?'</p>

<p>"'To work in the garden.'</p>

<p>"And my mother, having involuntarily turned her
eyes on this little square of weeds and plants run wild,
that she had called a garden, recognized with dismay
the improbability of her excuse.</p>

<p>"'This man,' said Madame Cornouiller, 'could just
as well work in your garden Monday or Tuesday.
Moreover, that will be much better. One should not
work on Sunday.'</p>

<p>"'He works all the week.'</p>

<p>"I have often noticed that the most absurd and
ridiculous reasons are the least disputed: they disconcert
the adversary. Madame Cornouiller insisted,
less than one might expect of a person so little disposed
to give up. Rising from her armchair, she asked:</p>

<p>"'What do you call your gardener, dearest?'</p>

<p>"'Putois,' answered my mother without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Putois was named. From that time he existed.
Madame Cornouiller took herself off, murmuring:
'Putois! It seems to me that I know that name.
Putois! Putois! I must know him. But I do not
recollect him. Where does he live?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1501">[Pg 1501]</span></p>

<p>"'He works by the day. When one wants him one
leaves word with this one or that one.'</p>

<p>"'Ah! I thought so, a loafer and a vagabond—a
good-for-nothing. Don't trust him, dearest.'</p>

<p>"From that time Putois had a character."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Messieurs Goubin and Jean Marteau having arrived,
Monsieur Bergeret put them in touch with the
conversation.</p>

<p>"We were speaking of him whom my mother caused
to be born gardener at Saint-Omer and whom she
christened. He existed from that time on."</p>

<p>"Dear master, will you kindly repeat that?" said
Monsieur Goubin, wiping the glass of his monocle.</p>

<p>"Willingly," replied Monsieur Bergeret. "There
was no gardener. The gardener did not exist. My
mother said: 'I am waiting for the gardener.' At
once the gardener was. He lived."</p>

<p>"Dear master," said Monsieur Goubin, "how could
he live since he did not exist?"</p>

<p>"He had a sort of existence," replied Monsieur Bergeret.</p>

<p>"You mean an imaginary existence," Monsieur Goubin
replied, disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Is it nothing then, but an imaginary existence?"
exclaimed the master. "And have not mythical beings
the power to influence men? Consider mythology,
Monsieur Goubin, and you will perceive that they are
not real beings but imaginary beings that exercise the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1502">[Pg 1502]</span>
most profound and lasting influence on the mind.
Everywhere and always, beings who have no more
reality than Putois have inspired nations with hatred
and love, terror and hope, have advised crimes, received
offerings, made laws and customs. Monsieur
Goubin, think of the eternal mythology. Putois is a
mythical personage, the most obscure, I grant you, and
of the lowest order. The coarse satyr, who in olden
times sat at the table with our peasants in the North,
was considered worthy of appearing in a picture by
Jordaens and a fable by La Fontaine. The hairy son
of Sycorax appeared in the noble world of Shakespeare.
Putois, less fortunate, will be always neglected by
artists and poets. He lacks bigness and the unusual
style and character. He was conceived by minds too
reasonable, among people who knew how to read and
write, and who had not that delightful imagination in
which fables take root. I think, Messieurs, that I have
said enough to show you the real nature of Putois."</p>

<p>"I understand it," said Monsieur Goubin.</p>

<p>And Monsieur Bergeret continued his discourse.</p>

<p>"Putois was. I can affirm it. He was. Consider it,
gentlemen, and you will admit that a state of being
by no means implies substance, and means only the
bonds attributed to the subject, expresses only a
relation."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p>"Undoubtedly," said Jean Marteau; "but a being
without attributes is a being less than nothing. I do
not remember who at one time said, 'I am that I am.'
Pardon my lapse of memory. One can not remember
everything. But the unknown who spoke in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1503">[Pg 1503]</span>fashion was very imprudent. In letting it be understood
by this thoughtless observation that he was
deprived of attributes and denied all relations, he
proclaimed that he did not exist and thoughtlessly
suppressed himself. I wager that no one has heard of
him since."—"You have lost," answered Monsieur
Bergeret. "He corrected the bad effect of these egotistical
expressions by employing quantities of adjectives,
and he is often spoken of, most often without
judgment."—"I do not understand," said Monsieur
Goubin.—"It is not necessary to understand," replied
Jean Marteau. And he begged Monsieur Bergeret to
speak of Putois.—"It is very kind of you to ask me,"
said the master.—"Putois was born in the second half
of the nineteenth century, at Saint-Omer. He would
have been better off if he had been born some centuries
before in the forest of Arden or in the forest of Brocéliande.
He would then have been a remarkably clever
evil spirit."—"A cup of tea, Monsieur Goubin," said
Pauline.—"Was Putois, then, an evil spirit?" said Jean
Marteau.—"He was evil," replied Monsieur Bergeret;
"he was, in a way, but not absolutely. It was true of
him as with those devils that are called wicked, but in
whom one discovers good qualities when one associates
with them. And I am disposed to think that injustice
has been done Putois. Madame Cornouiller, who,
warned against him, had at once suspected him of
being a loafer, a drunkard, and a robber, reflected that
since my mother, who was not rich, employed him, it
was because he was satisfied with little, and asked herself
if she would not do well to have him work instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1504">[Pg 1504]</span>
of her gardener, who had a better reputation, but expected
more. The time had come for trimming the
yews. She thought that if Madame Eloi Bergeret,
who was poor, did not pay Putois much, she herself,
who was rich, would give him still less, for it is customary
for the rich to pay less than the poor. And
she already saw her yews trimmed in straight hedges,
in balls and in pyramids, without her having to pay
much. 'I will keep an eye open,' she said, 'to see that
Putois does not loaf or rob me. I risk nothing, and it
will be all profit. These vagabonds sometimes do better
work than honest laborers.' She resolved to make
trial, and said to my mother: 'Dearest, send me Putois.
I will set him to work at Montplaisir.' My mother
would have done so willingly. But really it was impossible.
Madame Cornouiller waited for Putois at
Montplaisir, and waited in vain. She followed up her
ideas and did not abandon her plans. When she saw
my mother again, she complained of not having any
news of Putois. 'Dearest, didn't you tell him that I
was expecting him?'—'Yes! but he is strange, odd.'—'Oh,
I know that kind. I know your Putois by heart.
But there is no workman so crazy as to refuse to come
to work at Montplaisir. My house is known, I think.
Putois must obey my orders, and quickly, dearest. It
will be sufficient to tell me where he lives; I will go
and find him myself.' My mother answered that she
did not know where Putois lived, that no one knew his
house, that he was without hearth or home. 'I have
not seen him again, Madame. I believe he is hiding.'
What better could she say? Madame Cornouiller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1505">[Pg 1505]</span>
heard her distrustfully; she suspected her of misleading,
of removing Putois from inquiry, for fear of losing
him or making him ask more. And she thought
her too selfish. Many judgments accepted by the world
that history has sanctioned are as well founded as
that."—"That is true," said Pauline.—"What is true?"
asked Zoe, half asleep.—"That the judgments of history
are often false. I remember, papa, that you said
one day: 'Madame Roland was very ingenuous to appeal
to the impartiality of posterity, and not perceive
that, if her contemporaries were ill-natured monkeys,
their posterity would be also composed of ill-natured
monkeys.'"—"Pauline," said Mademoiselle Zoe severely,
"what connection is there between the story
of Putois and this that you are telling us?"—"A very
great one, my aunt."—"I do not grasp it."—Monsieur
Bergeret, who was not opposed to digressions, answered
his daughter: "If all injustices were finally
redressed in the world, one would never have imagined
another for these adjustments. How do you expect
posterity to pass righteous judgment on the dead?
How question them in the shades to which they have
taken flight? As soon as we are able to be just to
them we forget them. But can one ever be just? And
what is justice? Madame Cornouiller, at least, was
finally obliged to recognize that my mother had not
deceived her and that Putois was not to be found.
However, she did not give up trying to find him.
She asked all her relatives, friends, neighbors, servants,
and tradesmen if they knew Putois. Only two or
three answered that they had never heard of him. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1506">[Pg 1506]</span>
the most part they believed they had seen him. 'I have
heard that name,' said the cook, 'but I can not recall his
face.'—'Putois! I must know him,' said the street-sweeper,
scratching his ear. 'But I can not tell you
who it is.' The most precise description came from
Monsieur Blaise, receiver of taxes, who said that he
had employed Putois to cut wood in his yard, from
the 19th to the 23d of October, the year of the comet.
One morning, Madame Cornouiller, out of breath,
dropped into my father's office. 'I have seen Putois.
Ah! I have seen him.'—'You believe it?'—'I am sure.
He was passing close by Monsieur Tenchant's wall.
Then he turned into the Rue des Abbesses, walking
quickly. I lost him.'—'Was it really he?'—'Without
a doubt. A man of fifty, thin, bent, the air of a vagabond,
a dirty blouse.'—'It is true,' said my father, 'that
this description could apply to Putois.'—'You see!
Besides, I called him. I cried: "Putois!" and he
turned around.'—'That is the method,' said my father,
'that they employ to assure themselves of the identity
of evil-doers that they are hunting for.'—'I told you
that it was he! I know how to find him, your Putois.
Very well! He has a bad face. You had been very
careless, you and your wife, to employ him. I understand
physiognomy, and though I only saw his back,
I could swear that he is a robber, and perhaps an assassin.
The rims of his ears are flat, and that is a sign
that never fails.'—'Ah! you noticed that the rims of
his ears were flat?'—'Nothing escapes me. My dear
Monsieur Bergeret, if you do not wish to be assassinated
with your wife and your children, do not let
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1507">[Pg 1507]</span>
Putois come into your house again. Take my advice:
have all your locks changed.'—Well, a few days afterward,
it happened that Madame Cornouiller had
three melons stolen from her vegetable garden. The
robber not having been found, she suspected Putois.
The gendarmes were called to Montplaisir, and their
report confirmed the suspicions of Madame Cornouiller.
Bands of marauders were ravaging the gardens
of the countryside. But this time the robbery seemed
to have been committed by one man, and with singular
dexterity. No trace of anything broken, no footprints
in the damp earth. The robber could be no one
but Putois. That was the opinion of the corporal, who
knew all about Putois, and had tried hard to put his
hand on that bird. The 'Journal of Saint-Omer' devoted
an article to the three melons of Madame
Cornouiller, and published a portrait of Putois from
descriptions furnished by the town. 'He has,' said
the paper, 'a low forehead, squinting eyes, a shifty
glance, crow's-feet, sharp cheek-bones, red and shining.
No rims to the ears. Thin, somewhat bent, feeble
in appearance, in reality he is unusually strong. He
easily bends a five-franc piece between the first finger
and the thumb.' There were good reasons for attributing
to him a long series of robberies committed with
surprising dexterity. The whole town was talking of
Putois. One day it was learned that he had been arrested
and locked up in prison. But it was soon recognized
that the man that had been taken for him was
an almanac seller named Rigobert. As no charge could
be brought against him, he was discharged after fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1508">[Pg 1508]</span>
months of detention on suspicion. And Putois
remained undiscoverable. Madame Cornouiller was
the victim of another robbery, more audacious than
the first. Three small silver spoons were taken from
her sideboard. She recognized in this the hand of
Putois, had a chain put on the door of her bedroom,
and was unable to sleep...." </p>
</div>

<p>About ten o'clock in the evening, Pauline having
gone to her room, Mademoiselle Bergeret said to her
brother: "Do not forget to relate how Putois betrayed
Madame Cornouiller's cook."—"I was thinking of it,
my sister," answered Monsieur Bergeret. "To omit it
would be to lose the best of the story. But everything
must be done in order. Putois was carefully searched
for by the police, who could not find him. When it
was known that he could not be found, each one considered
it his duty to find him; the shrewd ones succeeded.
And as there were many shrewd ones at
Saint-Omer and in the suburbs, Putois was seen
simultaneously in the streets, in the fields, and in the
woods. Another trait was thus added to his character.
He was accorded the gift of ubiquity, the attribute of
many popular heroes. A being capable of leaping
long distances in a moment, and suddenly showing
himself at the place where he was least expected, was
honestly frightening. Putois was the terror of Saint-Omer.
Madame Cornouiller, convinced that Putois
had stolen from her three melons and three little
spoons, lived in a state of fear, barricaded at Montplaisir.
Bolts, bars, and locks did not reassure her.
Putois was for her a frightfully subtle being who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1509">[Pg 1509]</span>
could pass through doors. Trouble with her servants
redoubled her fear. Her cook having been betrayed,
the time came when she could no longer hide her misfortune.
But she obstinately refused to name her betrayer."—"Her
name was Gudule," said Mademoiselle
Zoe.—"Her name was Gudule, and she believed that
she was protected from danger by a long, forked
beard that she wore on her chin. The sudden appearance
of a beard protected the innocence of that holy
daughter of the king that Prague venerates. A beard,
no longer youthful, did not suffice to protect the virtue
of Gudule. Madame Cornouiller urged Gudule to tell
her the man. Gudule burst into tears, but kept silent.
Prayers and menaces had no effect. Madame Cornouiller
made a long and circumstantial inquiry. She
adroitly questioned her neighbors and tradespeople,
the gardener, the street-sweeper, the gendarmes; nothing
put her on the track of the culprit. She tried again
to obtain from Gudule a complete confession. 'In
your own interest, Gudule, tell me who it is.' Gudule
remained mute. All at once a ray of light flashed
through the mind of Madame Cornouiller: 'It is Putois!'
The cook cried, but did not answer. 'It is
Putois! Why did I not guess it sooner? It is Putois!
Miserable! miserable! miserable!' and Madame Cornouiller
remained convinced that it was Putois. Everybody
at Saint-Omer, from the judge to the lamplighter's
dog, knew Gudule and her basket. At the
news that Putois had betrayed Gudule, the town was
filled with surprise, wonder, and merriment.... With
this reputation in the town and its environs he remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1510">[Pg 1510]</span>
attached to our house by a thousand subtle
ties. He passed before our door, and it was believed
that he sometimes climbed the wall of our garden. He
was never seen face to face. At any moment we
would recognize his shadow, his voice, his footsteps.
More than once we thought we saw his back in the
twilight, at the corner of a road. To my sister and
me he gradually changed in character. He remained
mischievous and malevolent, but he became childlike
and very ingenuous. He became less real and, I dare
say, more poetical. He entered in the artless cycle of
childish traditions. He became more like Croquemitaine,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
like Père Fouettard, or the sand man who closes
the children's eyes when evening comes. It was not
that imp that tangled the colts' tails at night in the
stable. Less rustic and less charming, but equally and
frankly roguish, he made ink mustaches on my sister's
dolls. In our bed, before going to sleep, we listened;
he cried on the roofs with the cats, he howled with the
dogs, he filled the mill hopper with groans, and imitated
the songs of belated drunkards in the streets.
What made Putois ever-present and familiar to us, what
interested us in him, was that the remembrance of him
was associated with all the objects about us. Zoe's
dolls, my school books, in which he had many times
rumpled and besmeared the pages; the garden wall,
over which we had seen his red eyes gleam in the
shadow; the blue porcelain jar that he cracked one
winter's night, unless it was the frost; the trees, the
streets, the benches—everything recalled Putois, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1511">[Pg 1511]</span>children's Putois, a local and mythical being. He did
not equal in grace and poetry the dullest satyr, the
stoutest fawn of Sicily or Thessaly. But he was still
a demigod. He had quite a different character for our
father; he was symbolical and philosophical. Our
father had great compassion for men. He did not
think them altogether rational; their mistakes, when
they were not cruel, amused him and made him smile.
The belief in Putois interested him as an epitome and
a summary of all human beliefs. As he was ironical
and a joker, he spoke of Putois as if he were a real
being. He spoke with so much insistence sometimes,
and detailed the circumstances with such exactness,
that my mother was quite surprised and said to him in
her open-hearted way: 'One would say that you spoke
seriously, my friend: you know well, however....' He
replied gravely: 'All Saint-Omer believes in the existence
of Putois. Would I be a good citizen if I deny
him? One should look twice before setting aside an
article of common faith.' Only a perfectly honest soul
has such scruples. At heart my father was a Gassendiste.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
He keyed his own particular sentiment with
the public sentiment, believing, like the countryside, in
the existence of Putois, but not admitting his direct responsibility
for the theft of the melons and the betrayal
of the cook. Finally, he professed faith in the existence
of a Putois, to be a good citizen; and he eliminated
Putois in his explanations of the events that took
place in the town. By doing so in this instance, as in
all others, he was an honorable and a sensible man.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1512">[Pg 1512]</span></p>
<p>"As for our mother, she reproached herself somewhat
for the birth of Putois, and not without reason.
Because, after all, Putois was the child of our mother's
invention, as Caliban was the poet's invention. Without
doubt the faults were not equal, and my mother
was more innocent than Shakespeare. However, she
was frightened and confused to see her little falsehood
grow inordinately, and her slight imposture achieve
such a prodigious success, that, without stopping, extended
all over town and threatened to extend over the
world. One day she even turned pale, believing that
she would see her falsehood rise up before her. That
day, a servant she had, new to the house and the
town, came to say to her that a man wished to see
her. He wished to speak to Madame. 'What man is
it?'—'A man in a blouse. He looks like a laborer.'—'Did
he give his name?'—'Yes, Madame.'—'Well!
what is his name?'—'Putois.'—'He told you that was
his name?'—'Putois, yes, Madame.'—'He is here?'—'Yes,
Madame. He is waiting in the kitchen.'—'You
saw him?'—'Yes, Madame.'—'What does he want?'—'He
did not say. He will only tell Madame.'—'Go ask
him.'</p>

<p>"When the servant returned to the kitchen Putois
was gone. This meeting of the new servant with Putois
was never cleared up. But from that day I think my
mother commenced to believe that Putois might well
exist and that she had not told a falsehood after all."</p>

<p><em>Sac-au-dos means, literally, "pack-a-back."
The "Athenæum" calls the story "a masterpiece
of concentrated observation and description."
It was first published, with stories by
Zola, De Maupassant, and two others, in a
collection called "Soirées de Médan." Huysmans,
with his minute painting of detail, reminds
us of his Dutch ancestry of artists.
His art criticisms have marked him the most
vigorous and intelligent champion of the impressionists,
Moreau, Pissaro, Monet, and
Whistler.</em></p>

<p><em>He was born at Paris in 1848. After
1892, when he retired to the Trappe de Notre
Dame d'Igny, Huysmans showed an altogether
new side to his genius. His conversion to
Roman Catholicism became complete, and his
writings show a more sincere interest in religious
matters.</em></p>

<p class="center p2b">Translated by L. G. Meyer.<br> Copyright, 1907, by P. F. Collier &amp; Son.</p>


<p>As soon as I had finished my studies my parents
deemed it useful to my career to cause me
to appear before a table covered with green
cloth and surmounted by the living busts of some old
gentlemen who interested themselves in knowing
whether I had learned enough of the dead languages
to entitle me to the degree of Bachelor.</p>

<p>The test was satisfactory. A dinner to which all
my relations, far and near, were invited celebrated my
success, affected my future, and ultimately fixed me
in the law. Well I passed my examination and
got rid of the money provided for my first year's
expenses with a blonde girl who, at times, pretended
to be fond of me.</p>

<p>I frequented the Latin Quarter assiduously and
there I learned many things; among others to take
an interest in those students who blew their political
opinions into the foam of their beer, every night,
then to acquire a taste for the works of George Sand
and of Heine, of Edgard Quinet, and of Henri
Mürger.</p>

<p>The psychophysical moment of silliness was
upon me.</p>

<p>That lasted about a year; gradually I ripened. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1516">[Pg 1516]</span>electoral struggles of the closing days of the Empire
left me cold; I was the son neither of a Senator nor
a prescript and I had but to outlive, no matter what
the régime, the traditions of mediocrity and wretchedness
long since adopted by my family. The law
pleased me but little. I thought that the <em>Code</em> had
been purposely maldirected in order to furnish certain
people with an opportunity to wrangle, to the
utmost limit, over the smallest words; even to-day
it seems to me that a phrase clearly worded can not
reasonably bear such diverse interpretation.</p>

<p>I was sounding my depths, searching for some state
of being that I might embrace without too much disgust,
when the late Emperor found one for me; he
made me a soldier through the maladroitness of his
policy.</p>

<p>The war with Prussia broke out. To tell the truth
I did not understand the motives that made that
butchery of armies necessary. I felt neither the need
of killing others nor of being killed by them. However
that may be, enrolled in the <em>Garde mobile</em> of the
Seine, I received orders, after having gone in search
of an outfit, to visit the barber and to be at the barracks
in the Rue Lourcine at seven o'clock in the
evening.</p>

<p>I was at the place punctually. After roll-call part
of the regiment swarmed out of the barrack gates
and emptied into the street. Then the sidewalks raised
a shout and the gutters ran.</p>

<p>Crowding one against another, workmen in blouses,
workmen in tatters, soldiers strapped and gaitered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1517">[Pg 1517]</span>
without arms, they scanned to the clink of glasses
the Marseillaise over which they shouted themselves
hoarse with their voices out of time. Heads geared
with képis<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of incredible height and ornamented
with vizors fit for blind men and with tin cockades of
red, white and blue, muffled in blue-black jackets with
madder-red collars and cuffs, breeched in blue linen
pantaloons with a red stripe down the side, the militia
of the Seine kept howling at the moon before going
forth to conquer Prussia. That was a deafening uproar
at the wine shops, a hubbub of glasses, cans and
shrieks, cut into here and there by the rattling of a
window shaken by the wind. Suddenly the roll of the
drum muffled all that clamor; a new column poured
out of the barracks; there was carousing and tippling
indescribable. Those soldiers who were drinking
in the wine shops shot now out into the streets,
followed by their parents and friends who disputed
the honor of carrying their knapsacks; the ranks were
broken, it was a confusion of soldiers and citizens;
mothers wept, fathers, more contained, sputtered wine,
children frisked for joy and shrieked patriotic songs at
the top of their shrill voices.</p>

<p>They crossed Paris helter-skelter by the flashes of
lightning that whipped the storming clouds into white
zigzags. The heat was overpowering, the knapsack
was heavy; they drank at every corner of the street;
they arrived at last at the railway station of Aubervilliers.
There was a moment of silence broken by
the sound of sobbing, dominated again by a burst of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1518">[Pg 1518]</span>the Marseillaise, then they stalled us like cattle in the
cars. "Good night, Jules! may we meet soon again!
Be good! Above all write to me!" They squeezed
hands for a last time, the train whistled, we had left
the station. We were a regular shovelful of fifty
men in that box that rolled away with us. Some were
weeping freely, jeered at by the others who, completely
lost in drink were sticking lighted candles into
their provisions and bawling at the top of their voices;
"Down with Badinguet! and long live Rochefort!"<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Others, in a corner by themselves, stared silently and
sullenly at the broad floor that kept vibrating in the
dust. All at once the convoy makes a halt—I got out.
Complete darkness—twenty-five minutes after midnight.</p>

<p>On all sides stretch the fields, and in the distance,
lighted up by sharp flashes of lightning, a cottage, a
tree sketch their silhouette against a sky swollen by
the tempest. Only the grinding and rumbling of the
engine is heard, whose clusters of sparks flying from
the smokestack scatter like a bouquet of fireworks the
whole length of the train. Every one gets out, goes
forward as far as the engine, which looms up in the
night and becomes huge. The stop lasted quite two
hours. The signal disks flamed red, the engineer was
waiting for them to reverse. They turn; again we get
back into the wagons, but a man who comes up on
the run and swinging a lantern, speaks a few words
to the conductor, who immediately backs the train
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1519">[Pg 1519]</span>into a siding where we remain motionless. Not one
of us knows where we are. I descend again from the
carriage, and sitting on an embankment, I nibble at
a bit of bread and drink a drop or two, when the whirl
of a hurricane whistles in the distance, approaches,
roaring and vomiting fire, and an interminable train
of artillery passed at full speed, carrying along horses,
men, and cannon whose bronze necks sparkle in a
confusion of light. Five minutes after we take up
our slow advance, again interrupted by halts that grow
longer and longer. The journey ends with daybreak,
and leaning from the car window, worn out by the long
watch of the night, I look out upon the country that
surrounds us: a succession of chalky plains, closing
in the horizon, a band of pale green like the color of a
sick turquoise, a flat country, gloomy, meagre, the beggarly
Champagne Pouilleuse!</p>

<p>Little by little the sun brightens, we, rumbling on
the while, end, however, by getting there! Leaving
at eight o'clock in the evening, we were delivered at
three o'clock of the afternoon of the next day. Two
of the militia had dropped by the way, one who had
taken a header from the top of the car into the river,
the other who had broken his head on the ledge of a
bridge. The rest, after having pillaged the hovels and
the gardens met along the route wherever the train
stopped, either yawned, their lips puffed out with
wine, and their eyes swollen, or amused themselves
by throwing from one side of the carriage to the other
branches of shrubs and hen-coops which they had
stolen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1520">[Pg 1520]</span></p>

<p>The disembarking was managed after the same fashion
as the departure. Nothing was ready; neither
canteen, nor straw, nor coats, nor arms, nothing, absolutely
nothing. Only tents full of manure and of
insects, just left by the troops off for the frontier.
For three days we live at the mercy of Mourmelon.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Eating a sausage one day and drinking a bowl of café-au-lait
the next, exploited to the utmost by the natives,
sleeping, no matter how, without straw and without
covering. Truly such a life was not calculated to give
us a taste for the calling they had inflicted on us.</p>

<p>Once in camp, the companies separated; the laborers
took themselves to the tents of their fellows; the bourgeois
did the same. The tent in which I found myself
was not badly managed, for we succeeded in driving
out by argument of wine the two fellows, the native
odor of whose feet was aggravated by a long and
happy neglect.</p>

<p>One or two days passed. They made us mount
guard with the pickets, we drank a great deal of eau-de-vie,
and the drink-shops of Mourmelon were full
without let, when suddenly Canrobert<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> passed us in
review along the front line of battle. I see him now
on his big horse, bent over the saddle, his hair flying,
his waxed mustaches in a ghastly face. A mutiny was
breaking out. Deprived of everything, and hardly
convinced by that marshal that we lacked nothing, we
growled in chorus when he talked of repressing our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1521">[Pg 1521]</span>complaints by force: "Ran, plan, plan, a hundred
thousand men afoot, to Paris, to Paris!"</p>

<p>Canrobert grew livid, and shouted, planting his
horse in the midst of us. "Hats off to a marshal of
France!" Again a howl goes up from the ranks; then
turning bridle, followed in confusion by his staff officers,
he threatened us with his finger, whistling between
his separated teeth. "You shall pay dear for
this, gentlemen from Paris!"</p>

<p>Two days after this episode, the icy water of the
camp made me so sick that there was urgent need of my
entering the hospital. After the doctor's visit, I buckle
on my knapsack, and under guard of a corporal, here
I am going limping along, dragging my legs and
sweating under my harness. The hospital is gorged
with men; they send me back. I then go to one of
the nearest military hospitals; a bed stands empty; I
am admitted. I put down my knapsack at last, and
with the expectation that the major would forbid me
to move, I went out for a walk in the little garden
which connected the set of buildings. Suddenly there
issued from a door a man with bristling beard and
bulging eyes. He plants his hands in the pockets of
a long dirt-brown cloak, and shouts out from the distance
as soon as he sees me:</p>

<p>"Hey you, man! What are you doing over here?"
I approach, I explain to him the motive that brings
me. He thrashes his arms about and bawls:</p>

<p>"Go in again! You have no right to walk about
in this garden until they give you your costume."</p>

<p>I go back into the room, a nurse arrives and brings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1522">[Pg 1522]</span>
me a great military coat, pantaloons, old shoes without
heels, and a cap like a nightcap. I look at myself,
thus grotesquely dressed, in my little mirror. Good
Heavens, what a face and what an outfit! With my
haggard eyes and my sallow complexion, with my hair
cut short, and my nose with the bumps shining; with
my long mouse-gray coat, my pants stained russet, my
great heelless shoes, my colossal cotton cap, I am prodigiously
ugly. I could not keep from laughing. I turn
my head toward the side of my bed neighbor, a tall boy
of Jewish type, who is sketching my portrait in a notebook.
We become friends at once; I tell him to call me
Eugène Lejantel; he responds by telling me to call him
Francis Emonot; we recall to each other this and that
painter; we enter into a discussion of esthetics and forget
our misfortunes. Night arrives; they portion out
to us a dish of boiled meat dotted black with a few lentils,
they pour us out brimming cups of coco-clairet,
and I undress, enchanted at stretching myself out in
a bed without keeping my clothes and my shoes on.</p>

<p>The next morning I am awakened at about six
o'clock by a great fracas at the door and a clatter of
voices. I sit up in bed, I rub my eyes, and I see the
gentleman of the night before, still dressed in his
wrapper, brown the color of cachou, who advances
majestically, followed by a train of nurses. It was
the major. Scarcely inside, he rolls his dull green eyes
from right to left and from left to right, plunges his
hands in his pockets and bawls:</p>

<p>"Number One, show your leg—your dirty leg. Eh,
it's in a bad shape, that leg, that sore runs like a fountain;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1523">[Pg 1523]</span>
lotion of bran and water, lint, half-rations, a
strong licorice tea. Number Two, show your throat—your
dirty throat. It's getting worse and worse,
that throat; the tonsils will be cut out to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But, doctor—"</p>

<p>"Eh, I am not asking anything from you, am I?
Say one word and I'll put you on a diet."</p>

<p>"But, at least—"</p>

<p>"Put that man on a diet. Write: diet, gargles,
strong licorice tea."</p>

<p>In that vein he passed all the sick in review, prescribing
for all, the syphilitics and the wounded, the
fevered and the dysentery patients his strong licorice
tea. He stopped in front of me, stared into my face,
tore off my covering, punched my stomach with his
fist, ordered albuminated water for me, the inevitable
tea; and went out snorting and dragging his feet.</p>

<p>Life was difficult with the men who were about us.
There were twenty-one in our sleeping quarters. At
my left slept my friend, the painter; on my right, a
great devil of a trumpeter, with face pocked like a
sewing thimble and yellow as a glass of bile. He
combined two professions, that of cobbler by day and
a procurer of girls by night. He was, in other respects,
a comical fellow who frisked about on his hands,
or on his head, telling you in the most naïve way in the
world the manner in which he expedited at the toe
of his boot the work of his menials, or intoned in a
touching voice sentimental songs:</p>

<p>
"I have cherished in my sorrow—ow<br>
But the friendship of a swallow—ow."<br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1524">[Pg 1524]</span></p>

<p>I conquered his good graces by giving him twenty
sous to buy a liter of wine with, and we did well in
not being on bad terms with him, for the rest of our
quarters—composed in part of attorneys of the Rue
Maubuée—were well disposed to pick a quarrel
with us.</p>

<p>One night, among others, the 15th of August,
Francis Emonot threatened to box the ears of two men
who had taken his towel. There was a formidable
hubbub in the dormitory. Insults rained, we were
treated to "roule-en-coule et de duchesses." Being two
against nineteen, we were in a fair way of getting a
regular drubbing, when the bugler interfered, took
aside the most desperate and coaxed them into giving
up the stolen object. To celebrate the reconciliation
which followed this scene, Francis and I contributed
three francs each, and it was arranged that the bugler
with the aid of his comrades should try to slip out of
the hospital and bring back some meat and wine.</p>

<p>The light had disappeared from the major's window,
the druggist at last extinguished his, we climb
over the thicket, examine our surroundings, caution
the men who are gliding along the walls, not to encounter
the sentinels on the way, mount on one another's
shoulders and jump off into the field. An hour
later they came back laden with victuals; they pass
them over and reenter the dormitory with us; we suppress
the two night lamps, light candle-ends stuck on
the floor, and around my bed in our shirts we form a
circle. We had absorbed three or four liters of wine
and cut up the best part of a leg of mutton, when a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1525">[Pg 1525]</span>
great clattering of shoes is heard; I blow out the
candle stubs, by the grace of my shoe, and every one
escapes under the beds. The door opens; the major
appears, heaves a formidable "Good Heavens!" stumbles
in the darkness, goes out and comes back with a
lantern and the inevitable train of nurses. I profit by
the moment to disperse the remains of the feast; the
major crosses the dormitory at a quick step, swearing,
threatening to take us all into custody and to put us
in stocks.</p>

<p>We are convulsed with laughter under our coverings;
a trumpet-flourish blazes from the other side of
the dormitory. The major puts us all under diet; then
he goes out, warning us that we shall know in a few
minutes what metal he is made of.</p>

<p>Once gone, we vie with each other in doing our
worst; flashes of laughter rumble and crackle. The
trumpeter does a handspring in the dormitory, one of
his friends joins him, a third jumps on his bed as on
a springboard and bounces up and down, his arms
balancing, his shirt flying; his neighbor breaks into a
triumphant cancan; the major enters abruptly, orders
four men of the line he has brought with him to seize
the dancers, and announces to us that he is going to
draw up a report and send it to whom it may concern.</p>

<p>Calm is restored at last; the next day we get the
nurses to buy us some eatables. The days run on without
further incident. We are beginning to perish of
ennui in this hospital, when, one day, at five o'clock,
the doctor bursts into the room and orders us to put on
our campaign clothes and to buckle on our knapsacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1526">[Pg 1526]</span></p>

<p>We learn ten minutes later that the Prussians are
marching on Chalons.</p>

<p>A gloomy amazement reigns in the quarters. Until
now we have had no doubts as to the outcome of passing
events. We knew about the too celebrated victory
of Sarrebrück, we do not expect the reverses which
overwhelm us. The major examines every man; not
one is cured, all had been too long gorged with licorice
water and deprived of care. Nevertheless, he returns
to their corps the least sick, he orders others to
lie down completely dressed, knapsack in readiness.
Francis and I are among these last. The day passes,
the night passes. Nothing. But I have the colic continually
and suffer. At last, at about nine o'clock in
the morning, appears a long train of mules with
"cacolets,"<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and led by "tringlots."<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> We climb two
by two into the baskets. Francis and I were lifted
onto the same mule, only, as the painter was very fat
and I very lean, the arrangement see-sawed; I go up
in the air while he descends under the belly of the
mule, who, dragged by the head, and pushed from
behind, dances and flings about furiously. We trot
along in a whirlwind of dust, blinded, bewildered,
jolted, we cling to the bar of the cacolet, shut our
eyes, laugh and groan. We arrive at Chalons more
dead than alive; we fall to the gravel like jaded cattle,
then they pack us into the cars and we leave Chalons
to go—where? No one knows.</p>

<p>It is night; we fly over the rails. The sick are taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1527">[Pg 1527]</span>from the cars and walked up and down the platforms.
The engine whistles, slows down and stops in a railway
station—that of Reims, I suppose, but I can not
be sure. We are dying of hunger, the commissary forgot
but one thing: to give us bread for the journey. I
get out. I see an open buffet. I run for it, but others
are there before me. They are fighting as I come up.
Some were seizing bottles, others meat, some bread,
some cigars. Half-dazed but furious, the restaurant-keeper
defends his shop at the point of a spit. Crowded
by their comrades, who come up in gangs, the front
row of militia throw themselves onto the counter,
which gives way, carrying in its wake the owner of
the buffet and his waiters. Then followed a regular
pillage; everything went, from matches to toothpicks.
Meanwhile the bell rings and the train starts. Not one
of us disturbs himself, and while sitting on the walk, I
explain to the painter how the tubes work, the mechanism
of the bell. The train backs down over the
rails to take us aboard. We ascend into our compartments
again and we pass in review the booty we had
seized. To tell the truth, there was little variety of
food. Pork-butcher's meat and nothing but pork-butcher's
meat! We had six strings of Bologna sausages
flavored with garlic, a scarlet tongue, two sausages,
a superb slice of Italian sausage, a slice in silver
stripe, the meat all of an angry red, mottled white;
four liters of wine, a half-bottle of cognac, and a few
candle ends. We stick the candle ends into the neck
of our flasks, which swing, hung by strings to the
sides of the wagon. There was, thus, when the train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1528">[Pg 1528]</span>
jolted over a switch, a rain of hot grease which congealed
almost instantly into great platters, but our
coats had seen many another.</p>

<p>We began our repast at once, interrupted by the
going and coming of those of the militia who kept
running along the footboards the whole length of the
train, and knocked at our window-panes and demanded
something to drink. We sang at the top of our voices,
we drank, we clinked glasses. Never did sick men
make so much noise or romp so on a train in motion!
One would have said that it was a rolling Court of
Miracles; the cripples jumped with jointed legs, those
whose intestines were burning soaked them in bumpers
of cognac, the one-eyed opened their eyes, the fevered
capered about, the sick throats bellowed and tippled;
it was unheard of!</p>

<p>This disturbance ends in calming itself. I profit by
the lull to put my nose out of the window. There was
not a star there, not even a tip of the moon, heaven
and earth seem to make but one, and in that intensity
of inky blackness, the lanterns winked like eyes of different
colors attached to the metal of the disks. The
engineer discharged his whistle, the engine puffed and
vomited its sparks without rest. I reclose the window
and look at my companions. Some were snoring,
others disturbed by the jolting of the box, gurgled and
swore in their sleep, turning over incessantly, searching
for room to stretch their legs, to brace their heads
that nodded at every jolt.</p>

<p>By dint of looking at them, I was beginning to get
sleepy when the train stopped short and woke me up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1529">[Pg 1529]</span>
We were at a station; and the station-master's office
flamed like a forge fire in the darkness of the night.
I had one leg numbed, I was shivering with cold, I
descend to warm up a bit. I walk up and down the
platform, I go to look at the engine, which they uncouple,
and which they replace by another, and walking
by the office I hear the bills and the tic-tac of the
telegraph. The employee, with back turned to me, was
stooping a little to the right in such a way that
from where I was placed, I could see but the back of
his head and the tip of his nose, which shone red and
beaded with sweat, while the rest of his figure disappeared
in the shadow thrown by the screen of a gas-jet.</p>

<p>They invite me to get back into the carriage, and
I find my comrades again, just as I had left them.
That time I went to sleep for good. For how long did
my sleep last? I don't know—when a great cry woke
me up: "Paris! Paris!" I made a dash for the doorway.
At a distance, against a band of pale gold, stood
out in black the smokestacks of factories and workshops.
We were at Saint-Denis; the news ran from
car to car. Every one was on his feet. The engine
quickened its pace. The Gare du Nord looms up in
the distance. We arrive there, we get down, we
throw ourselves at the gates. One part of us succeeds
in escaping, the others are stopped by the employees
of the railroad and by the troops; by force they
make us remount into a train that is getting up steam,
and here we are again, off for God knows where!</p>

<p>We roll onward again all day long. I am weary of
looking at the rows of houses and trees that spin by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1530">[Pg 1530]</span>
before my eyes; then, too, I have the colic continually
and I suffer. About four o'clock of the afternoon, the
engine slackens its speed, and stops at a landing-stage
where awaits us there an old general, around whom
sports a flock of young men, with headgear of red
képis, breached in red and shod with boots with yellow
spurs. The general passes us in review and divides
us into two squads; the one for the seminary, the
other is directed toward the hospital. We are, it
seems, at Arras. Francis and we form part of the
first squad. They tumble us into carts stuffed with
straw, and we arrive in front of a great building that
settles and seems about to collapse into the street. We
mount to the second story to a room that contains some
thirty beds; each one of us unbuckles his knapsack,
combs himself, and sits down. A doctor arrives.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble with you?" he asks of the first.</p>

<p>"A carbuncle."</p>

<p>"Ah! and you?"</p>

<p>"Dysentery."</p>

<p>"Ah! and you?"</p>

<p>"A bubo."</p>

<p>"But in that case you have not been wounded during
the war?"</p>

<p>"Not the least in the world."</p>

<p>"Very well! You can take up your knapsacks
again. The archbishop gives up the beds of his seminarists
only to the wounded."</p>

<p>I pack into my knapsack again all the knickknacks
that I had taken out, and we are off again, willy-nilly,
for the city hospital. There was no more room there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1531">[Pg 1531]</span>
In vain the sisters contrive to squeeze the iron beds
together, the wards are full. Worn out by all these
delays, I seize one mattress, Francis takes another, and
we go and stretch ourselves in the garden on a great
grass-plot.</p>

<p>The next day I have a talk with the director, an
affable and charming man. I ask permission for the
painter and for me to go out into the town. He consents;
the door opens; we are free! We are going
to dine at last! To eat real meat, to drink real wine!
Ah, we do not hesitate; we make straight for the best
hotel in town. They serve us there with a wholesome
meal. There are flowers there on the table, magnificent
bouquets of roses and fuchsias that spread themselves
out of the glass vases. The waiter brings in a roast
that drains into a lake of butter; the sun himself comes
to the feast, makes the covers sparkle and the blades
of the knives, sifts his golden dust through the carafes,
and playing with the pomard that gently rocks in the
glasses, spots with a ruby star the damask cloth.</p>

<p>Oh, sacred joy of the guzzlers! My mouth is full
and Francis is drunk! The fumes of the roast mingle
with the perfume of the flowers; the purple of the wine
vies in gorgeousness with the red of the roses. The
waiter who serves us has the air of folly and we have
the air of gluttons, it is all the same to us! We stuff
down roast after roast, we pour down bordeaux upon
burgundy, chartreuse upon cognac. To the devil with
your weak wines and your thirty-sixes,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> which we have
been drinking since our departure from Paris! To the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1532">[Pg 1532]</span>devil with those whimsicalities without name, those
mysterious pot-house poisons with which we have been
so crammed to leanness for nearly a month! We are
unrecognizable; our once peaked faces redden like a
drunkard's, we get noisy, with noise in the air we cut
loose. We run all over the town that way.</p>

<p>Evening arrives; we must go back, however. The
sister who is in charge of the old men's ward says
to us in a small flute-like voice:</p>

<p>"Soldiers, gentlemen, you were very cold last night,
but you are going to have a good bed."</p>

<p>And she leads us into a great room where three
night lamps, dimly lighted, hang from the ceiling. I
have a white bed, I sink with delight between the
sheets that still smell fresh with the odor of washing.
We hear nothing but the breathing or the snoring of
the sleepers. I am quite warm, my eyes close, I know
no longer where I am, when a prolonged chuckling
awakes me. I open one eye and I perceive at the foot
of my bed an individual who is looking down at me.
I sit up in bed. I see before me an old man, tall, lean,
his eyes haggard, lips slobbering into a rough beard.
I ask what he wants of me. No answer! I cry out:
"Go away! Let me sleep!"</p>

<p>He shows me his fist. I suspect him to be a lunatic.
I roll up my towel, at the end of which I quietly twist
a knot; he advances one step; I leap to the floor; I
parry the fisticuff he aims at me, and with the towel
I deal him a return blow full in the left eye. He sees
thirty candles, he throws himself at me; I draw back
and let fly a vigorous kick in the stomach. He tumbles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1533">[Pg 1533]</span>
carrying with him a chair that rebounds; the
dormitory is awakened; Francis runs up in his shirt
to lend me assistance; the sister arrives; the nurses
dart upon the madman, whom they flog and succeed
with great difficulty in putting in bed again. The
aspect of the dormitory was eminently ludicrous; to
the gloom of faded rose, which the dying night lamps
had spread around them, succeeded the flaming of
three lanterns. The black ceiling, with its rings of
light that danced above the burning wicks, glittered
now with its tints of freshly spread plaster. The sick
men, a collection of Punch and Judies without age,
had clutched the piece of wood that hung at the end
of a cord above their beds, hung on to it with one
hand, and with the other made gestures of terror. At
that sight my anger cools, I split with laughter, the
painter suffocates, it is only the sister who preserves
her gravity and succeeds by force of threats and
entreaties in restoring order in the room.</p>

<p>Night came to an end, for good or ill; in the morning
at six o'clock the rattle of a drum assembled us,
the director called off the roll. We start for Rouen.
Arrived in that city, an officer tells the unfortunate
man in charge of us that the hospital is full and can
not take us in. Meanwhile we have an hour to wait.
I throw my knapsack down into a corner of the station,
and though my stomach is on fire, we are off,
Francis and I, wandering at random, in ecstasies before
the church of Saint-Ouen, in wonder before the
old houses. We admire so much and so long that the
hour had long since passed before we even thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1534">[Pg 1534]</span>
looking for the station again. "It's a long time since
your comrades departed," one of the employees of the
railroad said to us; "they are in Evreux." "The devil!
The next train doesn't go until nine o'clock.—Come,
let's get some dinner!"</p>

<p>When we arrived at Evreux, midnight had come.
We could not present ourselves at a hospital at such
an hour; we would have the appearance of malefactors.
The night is superb, we cross the city and we
find ourselves in the open fields. It was the time of
haying, the piles were in stacks. We spy out a little
stack in a field, we hollow out there two comfortable
nests, and I do not know whether it is the reminiscent
odor of our couch or the penetrating perfume of the
woods that stirs us, but we feel the need of airing our
defunct love affairs. The subject was inexhaustible.
Little by little, however, words become fewer, enthusiasm
dies out, we fall asleep. "Sacre bleu!" cries my
neighbor, as he stretches himself. "What time can it
be?" I awake in turn. The sun will not be late in
rising, for the great blue curtain is laced at the horizon
with a fringe of rose. What misery! It will be necessary
now to go knock at the door of the hospital,
to sleep in wards impregnated with that heavy smell
through which returns, like an obstinate refrain, the
acrid flower of powder of iodoform! All sadly we
take our way to the hospital again. They open to us
but alas! one only of us is admitted, Francis—and I,
they send me on to the lyceum. This life is no longer
possible, I meditate an escape, the house surgeon on
duty comes down into the courtyard. I show him my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1535">[Pg 1535]</span>
law-school diploma; he knows Paris, the Latin Quarter.
I explain to him my situation. "It has come to an
absolute necessity." I tell him "that either Francis
comes to the lyceum or that I go to rejoin him at the
hospital." He thinks it over, and in the evening, coming
close to my bed, he slips these words into my ear:
"Tell them to-morrow morning that your sufferings
increase." The next day, in fact, at about seven
o'clock, the doctor makes his appearance; a good, an
excellent man, who had but two faults; that of odorous
teeth and that of desiring to get rid of his patients at
any cost. Every morning the following scene took
place:</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! the fine fellow," he cries, "what an air he
has! good color, no fever. Get up and go take a good
cup of coffee; but no fooling, you know! don't go running
after the girls; I will sign for you your <em>Exeat</em>;
you will return to-morrow to your regiment."</p>

<p>Sick or not sick, he sent back three a day. That
morning he stops in front of me and says:</p>

<p>"Ah! saperlotte, my boy, you look better!"</p>

<p>I exclaim that never have I suffered so much.</p>

<p>He sounds my stomach. "But you are better," he
murmurs; "the stomach is not so hard." I protest—he
seems astonished, the interne then says to him in
an undertone:</p>

<p>"We ought perhaps to give him an injection; and
we have here neither syringe nor stomach-pump; if we
send him to the hospital—?"</p>

<p>"Come, now, that's an idea!" says the good man,
delighted at getting rid of me, and then and there he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1536">[Pg 1536]</span>
signs the order for my admission. Joyfully I buckle
on my knapsack, and under guard of one of the servants
of the lyceum I make my entrance at the hospital.
I find Francis again! By incredible good luck
the St. Vincent corridor, where he sleeps, in default
of a room in the wards, contains one empty bed next
to his. We are at last reunited! In addition to our
two beds, five cots stretch, one after the other, along
the yellow glazed walls. For occupants they have a
soldier of the line, two artillerymen, a dragoon, and a
hussar. The rest of the hospital is made up of certain
old men, crack-brained and weak-bodied, some young
men, rickety or bandy-legged, and a great number of
soldiers—wrecks from MacMahon's army—who, after
being floated on from one military hospital to another,
had come to be stranded on this bank. Francis and I,
we are the only ones who wear the uniform of the
Seine militia; our bed neighbors were good enough
fellows; one, to tell the truth, quite as insignificant as
another; they were, for the most part, the sons of
peasants or farmers called to serve under the flag after
the declaration of war.</p>

<p>While I am taking off my vest, there comes a sister,
so frail, so pretty that I can not keep from looking
at her; the beautiful big eyes! the long blond lashes!
the pretty teeth! She asks me why I have left the
lyceum; I explain to her in roundabout phrases how
the absence of a forcing pump caused me to be sent
back from the college. She smiles gently and says to
me: "Ah, sir soldier, you could have called the thing
by its name; we are used to everything." I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1537">[Pg 1537]</span>
think she was used to everything, unfortunate woman,
for the soldiers constrained themselves but little in
delivering themselves of their indiscreet amenities before
her. Yet never did I see her blush. She passed
among them mute, her eyes lowered, seeming not to
hear the coarse jokes retailed around her.</p>

<p>Heavens! how she spoiled me! I see her now in
the morning, as the sun breaks on the stone floor the
shadows of the window bars, approaching slowly from
the far end of the corridor, the great wings of her
bonnet flapping at her face. She comes close to my
bed with a dish that smokes, and on the edge of which
glistens her well-trimmed finger nail. "The soup is a
little thin to-day," she says with her pretty smile, "so
I bring you some chocolate. Eat it quick while it's
hot!"</p>

<p>In spite of the care she lavished upon me, I was
bored to death in that hospital. My friend and I, we
had reached that degree of brutishness that throws
you on your bed, trying to kill in animal drowsiness
the long hours of insupportable days. The only distractions
offered us consisted in a breakfast and a dinner
composed of boiled beef, watermelon, prunes, and
a finger of wine—the whole of not sufficient quantity
to nourish a man.</p>

<p>Thanks to my ordinary politeness toward the sisters
and to the prescription labels that I wrote for
them, I obtained fortunately a cutlet now and then and
a pear picked in the hospital orchard. I was, then, on
the whole, the least to be pitied of all the soldiers
packed together, pell-mell, in the wards, but during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1538">[Pg 1538]</span>
the first days I could not succeed even in swallowing
the meagre morning dole. It was inspection hour, and
the doctor chose that moment to perform his operations.
The second day after my arrival he ripped a
thigh open from top to bottom; I heard a piercing cry;
I closed my eyes, not enough, however, to avoid seeing
a red stream spurt in great jets on to the doctor's
apron. That morning I could eat no more. Little by
little, however, I grew accustomed to it; soon I contented
myself by merely turning my head away and
keeping my soup.</p>

<p>In the mean while the situation became intolerable.
We tried, but in vain, to procure newspapers and
books; we were reduced to masquerading, to donning
the hussar's vest for fun. This puerile fooling quickly
wore itself out, and stretching ourselves every twenty
minutes, exchanging a few words, we dive our heads
into the bolsters.</p>

<p>There was not much conversation to be drawn from
our comrades. The two artillerymen and the hussar
were too sick to talk. The dragoon swore by the name
of heaven, saying nothing, got up every instant, enveloped
in his great white mantle, and went to the
wash-bowls, whose sloppy condition he reported by
means of his bare feet. There were some old saucepans
lying about in which the convalescents pretended
to cook, offering their stew in jest to the sisters.</p>

<p>There remained, then, only the soldier of the line:
an unfortunate grocer's clerk, father of a child, called
to the army, stricken constantly by fever, shivering
under his bedclothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1539">[Pg 1539]</span></p>

<p>Squatting, tailor-fashion, on our bed, we listen to
him recount the battle in which he was picked up. Cast
out near Froeschwiller, on a plain surrounded with
woods, he had seen the red flashes shoot by in bouquets
of white smoke, and he had ducked, trembling, bewildered
by the cannonading, wild with the whistling
of the balls. He had marched, mixed in with the
regiments, through the thick mud, not seeing a single
Prussian, not knowing in what direction they were,
hearing on all sides groans, cut by sharp cries, then
the ranks of the soldiers placed in front of him, all
at once turned, and in the confusion of flight he had
been, without knowing how, thrown to the ground.
He had picked himself up and had fled, abandoning
his gun and knapsack, and at last, worn out by the
forced marches endured for eight days, undermined
by fear, weakened by hunger, he had rested himself in
a trench. He had remained there dazed, inert, stunned
by the roar of the bombs, resolved no longer to defend
himself, to move no more; then he thought of his wife,
and, weeping, demanded what he had done that they
should make him suffer so; he picked up, without
knowing why, the leaf of a tree, which he kept, and
which he had about him now, for he showed it to us
often, dried and shriveled at the bottom of his pockets.</p>

<p>An officer had passed meanwhile, revolver in hand,
had called him "coward," and threatened to break his
head if he did not march. He had replied: "That
would please me above all things. Oh, that this would
end!" But the officer at the very moment he was shaking
him on to his feet was stretched out, the blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1540">[Pg 1540]</span>
bursting, spurting from his neck. Then fear took possession
of him; he fled and succeeded in reaching a
road far off, overrun with the flying, black with troops,
furrowed by gun-carriages whose dying horses broke
and crushed the ranks.</p>

<p>They succeeded at last in putting themselves under
shelter. The cry of treason arose from the groups.
Old soldiers seemed once more resolved, but the recruits
refused to go on. "Let them go and be killed,"
they said, indicating the officers; "that's their profession.
As for me I have children; it's not the State
that will take care of them if I die!" And they
envied the fate of those who were slightly wounded
and the sick who were allowed to take refuge in the
ambulances.</p>

<p>"Ah, how afraid one gets, and, then, how one holds
in the ear the voices of men calling for their mothers
and begging for something to drink," he added, shivering
all over. He paused, and, looking about the
corridor with an air of content, he continued: "It's
all the same, I am very happy to be here; and then,
as it is, my wife can write to me," and he drew from
his trousers pocket some letters, saying with satisfaction:
"The little one has written, look!" and he points
out at the foot of the paper under his wife's labored
handwriting, some up-and-down strokes forming a dictated
sentence, where there were some "I kiss papas"
in blots of ink.</p>

<p>We listened twenty times at least to that story, and
we had to suffer during mortal hours the repetitions
of that man, delighted at having a child. We ended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1541">[Pg 1541]</span>
by stopping our ears and by trying to sleep so as not to
hear him any more.</p>

<p>This deplorable life threatened to prolong itself,
when one morning Francis, who, contrary to his habit,
had been prowling around the whole of the evening
before in the courtyard, says to me: "I say, Eugène,
come out and breathe a little of the air of the fields."
I prick my ears. "There is a field reserved for lunatics,"
he continued; "that field is empty; by climbing
onto the roofs of the outhouses, and that is easy, thanks
to the gratings that ornament the windows, we can
reach the coping of the wall; we jump and we tumble
into the country. Two steps from the wall is one of
the gates of Evreux. What do you say?"</p>

<p>I say—I say that I am quite willing to go out, but
how shall we get back?</p>

<p>"I do not know anything about that; first let us get
out, we will plan afterward. Come, get up, they are
going to serve the soup; we jump the wall after."</p>

<p>I get up. The hospital lacked water, so much so
that I was reduced to washing in the seltzer water
which the sister had had sent to me. I take my siphon,
I mark the painter who cries fire, I press the trigger,
the discharge hits him full in his face; then I place
myself in front of him, I receive the stream in my
beard, I rub my nose with the lather, I dry my face.
We are ready, we go downstairs. The field is deserted;
we scale the wall; Francis takes his measure
and jumps. I am sitting astride the coping of the
wall, I cast a rapid glance around me; below, a ditch
and some grass, on the right one of the gates of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1542">[Pg 1542]</span>
town; in the distance, a forest that sways and shows
its rents of golden red against a band of pale blue.
I stand up; I hear a noise in the court; I jump; we
skirt the walls; we are in Evreux!</p>

<p>Shall we eat? Motion adopted.</p>

<p>Making our way in search of a resting-place, we
perceive two little women wagging along. We follow
them and offer to breakfast with them; they refuse;
we insist; they answer no less gently; we insist again;
they say yes. We go home with them, with a meat-pie,
bottles of wine, eggs, and a cold chicken. It seems
odd to us to find ourselves in a light room, hung with
paper, spotted with lilac blossoms and green leaves;
there are at the casements damask curtains of red currant
color, a mirror over the fireplace, an engraving
representing a Christ tormented by the Pharisees. Six
chairs of cherry wood and a round table with an oil-cloth
showing the kings of France, a bedspread with
eiderdown of pink muslin. We set the table, we look
with greedy eye at the girls moving about. It takes
a long time to get things ready, for we stop them for
a kiss in passing; for the rest, they are ugly and stupid
enough. But what is that to us? It's so long since we
have scented the mouth of woman!</p>

<p>I carve the chicken; the corks fly, we drink like
topers, we eat like ogres. The coffee steams in the
cups; we gild it with cognac; my melancholy flies
away, the punch kindles, the blue flames of the Kirschwasser
leap in the salad bowl, the girls giggle, their
hair in their eyes. Suddenly four strokes ring out
slowly from the church tower. It is four o'clock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1543">[Pg 1543]</span>
And the hospital! Good heavens, we had forgotten
it! I turn pale. Francis looks at me in fright, we
tear ourselves from the arms of our hostesses, we go
out at double quick.</p>

<p>"How to get in?" says the painter.</p>

<p>Alas! we have no choice; we shall get there scarcely
in time for supper. Let's trust to the mercy of heaven
and make for the great gate!</p>

<p>We get there; we ring; the sister concièrge is about
to open the door for us and stands amazed. We
salute her, and I say loud enough to be heard by her:</p>

<p>"I say, do you know, they are not very amiable at
that commissariat; the fat one specially received us
only more or less civilly."</p>

<p>The sister breathes not a word. We run at a gallop
for the messroom; it was time, I heard the voice of
Sister Angèle who was distributing the rations. I
went to bed as quickly as possible, I covered with my
hand a spot my beauty had given me the length of
my neck; the sister looks at me, finds in my eyes an
unwonted sparkle, and asks with interest: "Are your
pains worse?"</p>

<p>I reassure her and reply: "On the contrary, sister, I
am better; but this idleness and this imprisonment are
killing me."</p>

<p>When I speak of the appalling ennui that is trying
me, sunk in this company, in the midst of the country,
far from my own people, she does not reply, but her
lips close tight, her eyes take on an indefinable expression
of melancholy and of pity. One day she said to
me in a dry tone: "Oh, liberty's worth nothing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1544">[Pg 1544]</span>
you," alluding to a conversation she had overheard
between Francis and me, discussing the charming allurements
of Parisian women; then she softened and
added with her fascinating little moue: "You are really
not serious, Mr. Soldier."</p>

<p>The next morning we agreed, the painter and I, that
as soon as the soup was swallowed, we would scale
the wall again. At the time appointed we prowl about
the field; the door is closed. "Bast, worse luck!" says
Francis, "<em>En avant!</em>" and he turns toward the great
door of the hospital. I follow him. The sister in
charge asks where we are going. "To the commissariat."
The door opens, we are outside.</p>

<p>Arrived at the grand square of the town, in front
of the church, I perceive, as we contemplate the sculptures
of the porch, a stout gentleman with a face like
a red moon bristling with white mustaches, who stares
at us in astonishment. We stare back at him, boldly,
and continue on our way. Francis is dying of thirst;
we enter a café, and, while sipping my demi-tasse, I
cast my eyes over the local paper, and I find there a
name that sets me dreaming. I did not know, to tell
the truth, the person who bore it, but that name recalled
to me memories long since effaced. I remembered
that one of my friends had a relation in a very
high position in the town of Evreux. "It is absolutely
necessary for me to see him," I say to the painter; I
ask his address of the café-keeper; he does not know
it; I go out and visit all the bakers and the druggists
that I meet with. Every one eats bread and takes
medicine; it is impossible that one of those manufacturers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1545">[Pg 1545]</span>
should not know the address of Monsieur de
Fréchêdé. I did find it there, in fact; I dust off my
blouse, I buy a black cravat, gloves, and I go and ring
gently, in the Rue Chatrain, at the iron grating of a
private residence which rears its brick façade and slate
roofs in the clearing of a sunny park. A servant lets
me in. Monsieur de Fréchêdé is absent, but Madame
is at home. I wait for a few seconds in a salon; the
portière is raised and an old lady appears. She has
an air so affable that I am reassured. I explain to her
in a few words who I am.</p>

<p>"Sir," she says with a kind smile, "I have often
heard speak of your family. I think, even, that I have
met at Madame Lezant's, madame, your mother, during
my last journey to Paris; you are welcome here."</p>

<p>We talked a long time; I, somewhat embarrassed,
covering with my képi the spot on my neck; she
trying to persuade me to accept some money, which
I refuse.</p>

<p>She says to me at last: "I desire with all my heart
to be useful to you. What can I do?" I reply:
"Heavens, Madame, if you could get them to send me
back to Paris, you would render me a great service;
communications will be interrupted very soon, if the
newspapers are to be believed; they talk of another
<em>coup d'état</em>, or the overthrow of the Empire; I have
great need of seeing my mother again; and especially
of not letting myself be taken prisoner here if the
Prussians come."</p>

<p>In the mean while Monsieur de Fréchêdé enters.
In two words he is made acquainted with the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1546">[Pg 1546]</span></p>

<p>"If you wish to come with me to the doctor of the
hospital," he says, "you have no time to lose."</p>

<p>To the doctor! Good heavens! and how account to
him for my absence from the hospital? I dare not
breathe a word; I follow my protector, asking myself
how it will all end. We arrive; the doctor looks at
me with a stupefied air. I do not give him time to
open his mouth, and I deliver with prodigious volubility
a string of jeremiads over my sad position.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Fréchêdé in his turn takes up the argument,
and asks him, in my favor, to give me a convalescent's
leave of absence for two months.</p>

<p>"Monsieur is, in fact, sick enough," says the doctor,
"to be entitled to two months' rest; if my colleagues
and if the General look at it as I do your protégé will
be able in a few days to return to Paris."</p>

<p>"That's good," replies Monsieur de Fréchêdé. "I
thank you, doctor; I will speak to the General myself
to-night."</p>

<p>We are in the street; I heave a great sigh of relief;
I press the hand of that excellent man who shows so
kindly an interest in me. I run to find Francis again.
We have but just time to get back; we arrive at the
gate of the hospital; Francis rings; I salute the sister.
She stops me: "Did you not tell me this morning that
you were going to the commissariat?"</p>

<p>"Quite right, sister."</p>

<p>"Very well! the General has just left here. Go and
see the director and Sister Angèle; they are waiting
for you; you will explain to them, no doubt, the object
of your visits to the commissariat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1547">[Pg 1547]</span></p>

<p>We remount, all crestfallen, the dormitory stairs.
Sister Angèle is there, who waits for us, and who says:</p>

<p>"Never could I have believed such a thing! You
have been all over the city, yesterday and to-day,
and Heaven knows what kind of life you have been
leading!"</p>

<p>"Oh, really!" I exclaim.</p>

<p>She looked at me so fixedly that I breathed not
another word.</p>

<p>"All the same," she continued, "the General himself
met you on the Grand Square to-day. I denied that
you had gone out, and I searched for you all over the
hospital. The General was right, you were not here.
He asked me for your names; I gave him the name of
one of you, I refused to reveal the other, and I did
wrong, that is certain, for you do not deserve it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, how much I thank you, my sister!" But Sister
Angèle did not listen to me. She was indignant over
my conduct! There was but one thing to do; keep
quiet and accept the downpour without trying to shelter
myself.</p>

<p>In the mean time Francis was summoned before the
director, and since, I do not know why, they suspected
him of corrupting me; and since he was, moreover, by
reason of his foolery, in bad odor with the doctor and
the sisters, he was informed that he must leave the
hospital the following day and join his corps at once.</p>

<p>"Those huzzies with whom we dined yesterday are
licensed women, who have sold us; it was the director
himself who told me," he declared furiously.</p>

<p>All the time we are cursing the jades and lamenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1548">[Pg 1548]</span>
over our uniforms which made us so recognizable, the
rumor runs that the Emperor is taken prisoner and
that the Republic has been proclaimed at Paris; I give
a franc to an old man who was allowed to go out and
who brings me a copy of the "Gaulois." The news is
true. The hospital exults. Badinguet fallen! it is not
too soon; good-by to the war that is ended at last.</p>

<p>The following morning Francis and I, we embrace
and he departs. "Till we meet again," he shouts to
me as he shuts the gate; "and in Paris!"</p>

<p>Oh, the days that followed that day! What suffering!
what desolation! Impossible to leave the hospital;
a sentinel paced up and down, in my honor,
before the door. I had, however, spirit enough not to
try to sleep. I paced like a caged beast in the yard.
I prowled thus for the space of twelve hours. I knew
my prison to its smallest cranny. I knew the spots
where the lichens and the mosses pushed up through
the sections of the wall which had given way in cracking.
Disgust for my corridor, for my truckle-bed flattened
out like a pancake, for my linen rotten with dirt,
took hold of me. I lived isolated, speaking to no one,
beating the flint stones of the courtyard with my feet,
straying, like a troubled soul, under the arcades whitewashed
with yellow ochre the same as the wards, coming
back to the grated entrance gate surmounted by a
flag, mounting to the first floor where my bed was,
descending to where the kitchen shone, flashing the
sparkle of its red copper through the bare nakedness
of the scene. I gnawed my fists with impatience,
watching at certain hours the mingled coming and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1549">[Pg 1549]</span>
going of civilians and soldiers, passing and repassing
on every floor, filling the galleries with their interminable
march.</p>

<p>I had no longer any strength left to resist the persecution
of the sisters, who drove us on Sunday into
the chapel. I became a monomaniac; one fixed idea
haunted me; to flee as quickly as possible that lamentable
jail. With that, money worry oppressed me. My
mother had forwarded a hundred francs to me at Dunkirk,
where it seems I ought to be. The money never
appeared. I saw the time when I should not have a
sou to buy either paper or tobacco.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the days passed. The De Fréchêdés
seemed to have forgotten me, and I attributed their
silence to my escapades, of which they had no doubt
been informed. Soon to all these anxieties were added
horrible pains: ill-cared for and aggravated by my
chase after petticoats, my bowels became inflamed. I
suffered so that I came to fear I should no longer be
able to bear the journey. I concealed my sufferings,
fearing the doctor would force me to stay longer at
the hospital. I keep my bed for a few days; then, as
I felt my strength diminishing, I wished to get up, in
spite of all, and I went downstairs into the yard. Sister
Angèle no longer spoke to me, and in the evening,
while she made her rounds in the corridor and in the
mess, turning so as not to notice the sparks of the forbidden
pipes that glowed in the shadows, she passed
before me, indifferent, cold, turning away her eyes.
One morning, however, when I had dragged myself
into the courtyard and sunk down on every bench to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1550">[Pg 1550]</span>
rest, she saw me so changed, so pale, that she could
not keep from a movement of compassion. In the
evening, after she had finished her visit to the dormitories,
I was leaning with one elbow on my bolster,
and, with eyes wide open, I was looking at the bluish
beams which the moon cast through the windows of
the corridor, when the door at the farther end opened
again, and I saw, now bathed in silver vapor, now in
shadow, and as if clothed in black crepe, according as
to whether she passed before the casements or along
the walls, Sister Angèle, who was coming toward me.
She was smiling gently. "To-morrow morning," she
said to me, "you are to be examined by the doctors. I
saw Madame de Fréchêdé to-day; it is probable that
you will start for Paris in two or three days." I spring
up in my bed, my face brightens, I wanted to jump
and sing; never was I happier. Morning rises. I
dress, and uneasy, nevertheless, I direct my way to the
room where sits a board of officers and doctors.</p>

<p>One by one the soldiers exhibit their bodies gouged
with wounds or bunched with hair. The General
scraped one of his finger nails, the Colonel of the
Gendarmerie<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> fans himself with a newspaper; the practitioners
talk among themselves as they feel the men.
My turn comes at last. They examine me from head
to foot, they press down on my stomach, swollen and
tense like a balloon, and with a unanimity of opinion
the council grants me a convalescent's leave of sixty
days.</p>

<p>I am going at last to see my mother, to recover my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1551">[Pg 1551]</span>curios, my books! I feel no more the red-hot iron that
burns my entrails; I leap like a kid!</p>

<p>I announce to my family the good news. My
mother writes me letter after letter, wondering why
I do not come. Alas! my order of absence must be
countersigned at the division headquarters at Rouen.
It comes back after five days; I am "in order"; I go
to find Sister Angèle; I beg her to obtain for me before
the time fixed for my departure permission to go into
the city to thank De Fréchêdés, who have been so
good to me. She goes to look for the director and
brings me back permission. I run to the house of
those kind people, who force me to accept a silk handkerchief
and fifty francs for the journey. I go in
search of my papers at the commissariat. I return
to the hospital, I have but a few minutes to spare.
I go in quest of Sister Angèle, whom I find in the
garden, and I say to her with great emotion:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Sister, I am leaving; how can I ever repay
you for all that you have done for me?"</p>

<p>I take her hand which she tries to withdraw, and
I carry it to my lips. She grows red. "Adieu!" she
murmurs, and, menacing me with her finger, she adds
playfully, "Be good! and above all do not make any
wicked acquaintances on the journey."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not fear, my Sister. I promise you!"</p>

<p>The hour strikes; the door opens; I hurry off to
the station; I jump into a car; the train moves; I have
left Evreux. The coach is half full, but I occupy
fortunately, one of the corners. I put my nose out
of the window; I see some pollarded trees, the tops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1552">[Pg 1552]</span>
of a few hills that undulate away into the distance, a
bridge astride of a great pond that sparkles in the sun
like burnished glass. All this is not very pleasing.
I sink back in my corner, looking now and then at
the telegraph wires that stripe the ultramarine sky
with their black lines, when the train stops, the travellers
who are about me descend, the door shuts, then
opens again and makes way for a young woman.
While she seats herself and arranges her dress, I
catch a glimpse of her face under the displacing of
her veil. She is charming; with her eyes full of the
blue of heaven, her lips stained with purple, her white
teeth, her hair the color of ripe corn. I engage her
in conversation. She is called Reine; embroiders
flowers; we chat like old friends. Suddenly she turns
pale, and is about to faint. I open the windows, I
offer her a bottle of salts which I have carried with
me ever since my departure from Paris; she thanks
me, it is nothing, she says, and she leans on my knapsack
and tries to sleep. Fortunately we are alone in
the compartment, but the wooden partition that
divides into equal parts the body of the carriage
comes up only as far as the waist, and one can see
and above all hear the clamor and the coarse laughter
of the country men and women. I could have thrashed
them with hearty good will, these imbeciles who were
troubling her sleep! I contented myself with listening
to the commonplace opinions which they exchanged on
politics. I soon have enough of it; I stop my ears. I,
too, try to sleep; but that phrase which was spoken by
the station-master of the last station, "You will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1553">[Pg 1553]</span>
get to Paris, the rails are torn up at Mantes," returned
in all my dreams like an obstinate refrain. I open my
eyes. My neighbor wakes up, too; I do not wish to
share my fears with her; we talk in a low voice. She
tells me that she is going to join her mother at Sèvres.
"But," I say to her, "the train will scarcely enter Paris
before eleven o'clock to-night. You will never have
time to reach the landing on the left bank."</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" she says, "if my brother is not
down at my arrival?"</p>

<p>Oh, misery, I am as dirty as a comb and my stomach
burns! I can not dream of taking her to my bachelor
lodgings, and then I wish before all to see my mother.
What to do? I look at Reine with distress. I take
her hand; at that moment the train takes a curve,
the jerk throws her forward; our lips approach, they
touch, I press mine; she turns red. Good heavens,
her mouth moves imperceptibly; she returns my kiss;
a long thrill runs up my spine; at contact of those
ardent embers my senses fail. Oh! Sister Angèle,
Sister Angèle! a man can not make himself over!
And the train roars and rolls onward, without slackening
speed; we are flying under full steam toward
Mantes; my fears are vain; the track is clear. Reine
half shuts her eyes; her head falls on my shoulder; her
little waves of hair tangle with my beard and tickle
my lips. I put my arm about her waist, which yields,
and I rock her. Paris is not far; we pass the freight-depots,
by the roundhouses where the engines roar in
red vapor, getting up steam; the train stops; they take
up the tickets. After reflection, I will take Reine to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1554">[Pg 1554]</span>
my bachelor rooms, provided her brother is not waiting
her arrival. We descend from the carriage; her
brother is there. "In five days," she says, with a
kiss, and the pretty bird has flown. Five days after
I was in my bed, atrociously sick, and the Prussians
occupy Sèvres. Never since then have I seen her.</p>

<p>My heart is heavy. I heave a deep sigh; this is not,
however, the time to be sad! I am jolting on in a
fiacre. I recognize the neighborhood; I arrive before
my mother's house; I dash up the steps, four at a time.
I pull the bell violently; the maid opens the door. "It's
Monsieur!" and she runs to tell my mother, who darts
out to meet me, turns pale, embraces me, looks me over
from head to foot, steps back a little, looks at me once
more, and hugs me again. Meanwhile the servant
has stripped the buffet. "You must be hungry, M.
Eugène?" I should think I was hungry! I devour
everything they give me. I toss off great glasses of
wine; to tell the truth, I do not know what I am eating
and what I am drinking!</p>

<p>At length I go to my rooms to rest. I find my lodging
just as I left it. I run through it, radiant, then I
sit down on the divan and I rest there, ecstatic, beatific,
feasting my eyes with the view of my knickknacks and
my books. I undress, however; I splash about in a
great tub, rejoicing that for the first time in many
months I am going to get into a clean bed with white
feet and toenails trimmed. I spring onto the mattress,
which rebounds. I dive my head into the feather pillow,
my eyes close; I soar on full wings into the land
of dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1555">[Pg 1555]</span></p>

<p>I seem to see Francis, who is lighting his enormous
wooden pipe, and Sister Angèle, who is contemplating
me with her little moue; then Reine advances toward
me, I awake with a start, I behave like an idiot, I sink
back again up to my ears, but the pains in my bowels,
calmed for a moment, awake, now that the nerves become
less tense, and I rub my stomach gently, thinking
that the horrors of dysentery are at last over! I
am at home. I have my rooms to myself, and I say
to myself that one must have lived in the promiscuosity
of hospitals and camps to appreciate the value of a
basin of water, to appreciate the solitude where modesty
may rest at ease.</p>

<p><em>This poet and teller of tales was born at
Médéa, Algeria, in 1849. His tremendous exuberance
of spirits at first found an outlet in
military service during the war of 1870, and
later in a collection of vagabond songs called
"La Chanson des Gueux," for which shock to
the conventions he was sent to prison for a
month. Between 1877 and 1879 he published
a variety of ballads while pursuing in picturesque
flashes the careers of sailor and lighterman.</em></p>

<p><em>Richepin has written many stories, more or
less with a penchant for extraordinary sensations
and psychological anomalies. "Nana
Sahib" is a play he wrote in 1883, in which, for
a short time, he acted the principal rôle with
Sarah Bernhardt.</em></p>

<p><em>Richepin is distinguished by his truly subtle
use of words, by an unbridled, almost truculent,
eloquence, clothed in rich and savory
language.</em></p>

"Modernity, the essence of inquietude!"<br>
<br>
—<em>Adrien Juvigny.</em></p>


<p class="center p2b">Translated by Mason Carnes.<br> Copyright, 1894, by The Current Literature
Publishing Company.</p>


<p>Ferdinand Octave Bruat awoke one
morning with an idea. Ferdinand Octave
Bruat was what one commonly calls a man of
letters. He had written verses that no one would publish,
novels that all the publishers had returned unread,
theatrical effusions that even the director of the Funambules
had refused. However, he had, in default
of talent, a theory, an ideal. He thought himself called
to be a leader, and firmly believed that he had invented
a modern school. He meant by that, all that constitutes
our daily life, so bizarre on this side, so practical
on that, so foolish on others. He maintained that the
time had come to attack boldly all imitations, classic as
well as romantic, and that he should ransack contemporaneous
society to derive therefrom ideas, forms, a
language absolutely new and original. He said that
as each epoch had had its own expression so ours
should have its own also.</p>

<p>He was not wrong. Unfortunately he had not the
strength to carry to battle the standard he had raised,
and all his valiance merely ended in debating much
and haranguing in the cafés. He overthrew more fools
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1560">[Pg 1560]</span>than bigots and made more debts than masterpieces.
But one morning, on rising, he found the masterpiece
which he had sought. When I say he had found it,
I am mistaken. <em>He had given birth to a title!</em></p>

<p>What to do with it? As yet he did not know. But
the title seemed to him eloquent, sonorous, easy to
remember, rich in variations, full of modernity, epitomizing
the whole century in a manner at once simple
and complex. The title was the more wonderful that
it was so common. It was a phrase of two words,
spoken thousands of times each morning; a phrase
without affectation, without pretense, without pedantry,
neither classic nor romantic. It was simply,
"<em>Bonjour, Monsieur!</em>"</p>

<p>Under this title he wrote first a sonnet. This sonnet
was read to his friends, naturally accompanied by
prefaces and commentaries philological as well as philosophical,
destined not only to make them the better
enjoy its essence, but also to make them thoroughly
comprehend its import. With one voice it was pronounced
admirable.</p>

<p>"It must be published at once," cried the most enthusiastic;
"it will give the keynote to the poetry of
the future."</p>

<p>One crabbed old fellow, who did not dare to give
his opinion frankly, but who was irritated by this
success, turned his criticism into a compliment.</p>

<p>"As for me," he said, "I believe the subject demands
greater development. Certainly the sonnet is beautiful;
but does it not strike you that it is not sufficient
for a subject of such importance. Think of it! A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1561">[Pg 1561]</span>
thing so profound, so varied, so complicated can not
be confined in fourteen lines. A thought so powerful
breaks its mold. Were I Bruat, I would turn my
sonnet into a drama."</p>

<p>The assemblage adopted his opinion, enchanted at
heart to see the famous sonnet thus criticized. Bruat
did not perceive the irony of the grumbler. "You are
right," said he with an air of superiority. "I have
compressed my idea into this narrow mold. Thanks
for your criticism, which proves how much you esteem
me. Truly my idea deserves more than fourteen lines.
I will write a drama in five acts and nine tableaux."
And, in spite of the hypocritical protestations of
his friends, he tore into pieces his masterpiece of a
sonnet.</p>

<p>He lived for five years on the memory of his sonnet.
He was always promising the astonishing drama—"Bonjour,
Monsieur!" He was becoming almost celebrated
by this piece in embryo. They knew that he
had but a few scenes to finish; they said that the work
was advancing. The simple-minded and the prejudiced
who had never seen the author were convinced
of his genius and spread his renown. To believe them,
there was a great future, a marvelous hope; one must
wait for the thunderclap. No doubt he was taking his
time; but do not aloes take a hundred years to
flower?</p>

<p>At last the drama was finished. This was a great
event for the daily papers. What theatre would be
the battlefield of the new school? Without doubt the
directors would dispute for the honor of presenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1562">[Pg 1562]</span>
to the public the principal work of the nineteenth
century? Would there be artists capable of interpreting
it?</p>

<p>First of all, Bruat assembled his little court, wishing
to give them the first-fruits of his victory. The drama
did not meet with the success of the sonnet. Perhaps
the wits had conceived in advance too high an idea of
it? Perhaps Bruat had not been as brilliant as they
had expected? Perhaps there was a little envy mingled
with their judgment? Perhaps, also, the auditors
were less young and therefore less enthusiastic? In
short, the reading was a failure. The grumbler alone
protested against the general coldness, and made a
parade of an unlimited admiration.</p>

<p>"Well and good," said he; "here is something that
expresses the idea in quest, here is movement, life,
research, keenness. Away with the sonnet! My friend,
you have found the new drama, the modern drama, the
drama of the future."</p>

<p>But Bruat was disheartened. At least he mistrusted
the grumbler, who had counseled him to substitute the
drama for the sonnet. He owed him a grudge because
the drama had produced no effect in comparison with
the sonnet. "Well," said he to the others, "where am
I at fault?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in nothing, nothing at all," replied the chorus
of friends.</p>

<p>"However, my drama does not meet with your
approval; I see it clearly."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to tell you the truth?" interrupted
one, emboldened by Bruat's failure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1563">[Pg 1563]</span></p>

<p>"Say it, my friend, for you know it is my principle
to seek truth everywhere."</p>

<p>"Well, I think that modern life is too complicated
for the drama. There are casualties, phenomena of
the heart, complications of sentiment, descriptions material
and spiritual, inquiries physiological and psychological,
which can not be expressed in action. You
have striven against the difficulty. Sometimes you
have avoided it, which has caused a lack of unity.
Sometimes you have been overwhelmed by it, which
has caused a lack of polish. In spite of all your talents
you have not been able to control this monster. Your
plot is obscure, your characters badly drawn, your conclusion
unnatural. But, on the other hand, what observation!
what brilliant analysis! what force of penetration!
what language! Oh! to be inspired in spite
of the obstacles, you must be a man of genius. What
would you? The impossible can not be achieved. In
your case I would recast everything; I would expand,
I would clarify, I would develop, I would take my
time, I would enlarge my frame to the size of my idea.
I would turn my drama into a novel."</p>

<p>"He is right," said the chorus, "he is right. That
is the point. You must make a novel of 'Bonjour,
Monsieur!'"</p>

<p>The opinion was unanimous. Bruat was too sincere
not to be guided by it. Heroically he burned his
drama, and set to work on his novel. In this work he
spent ten years. To him it was the time of apotheosis.
He had more prophets than God. Some exalted him
from real admiration; others, because they thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1564">[Pg 1564]</span>
he would accomplish nothing, and that, therefore, he
would not be a dangerous adversary, spread his praises.
Critics used his name to crush budding authors. Journalists
filled up spaces with notices of his novel, with
anecdotes of the labor in the thousand and one alterations
in his work. The ignorant, the foolish, the gossips
chattered about him without knowing why. He
became as famous as the obelisk.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they finished by waiting. The echo of
his glory became fainter as it passed from one generation
to another. At sixty he was about forgotten. He
was only spoken of from time to time, and then merely
as an eccentric, almost a lunatic. They remembered
vaguely that he was working at a great novel, but they
doubted whether he would ever finish it, or, rather,
they were sure that he would never reach the end.
They never spoke but with a smile of his gigantic
undertaking, of the twenty volumes which would
epitomize the nineteenth century, of this creation
which would be the babel and pandemonium of
modern life.</p>

<p>They would have laughed much more could they
have known on what Bruat was engaged in his old age.</p>

<p>The unhappy man had finished his formidable novel.
He had written twenty-seven volumes under the wonderful
title, "Bonjour, Monsieur!" But at the end of
his labor, frightened at having spoken at such length,
he did not dare the trial of the reading. Then he set
to work to abridge, to cut, to condense. By this means
he had, little by little, reduced the book first to ten
volumes, then to two, then to one. Finally, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1565">[Pg 1565]</span>
epitomized everything into a story of one hundred
pages.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Octave Bruat was then eighty years old.
One friend alone remained to him, the confidant of his
undying ambition.</p>

<p>"Publish your story," said his friend: "I assure you
it will make a sensation in the world. It is the paragon
of modernity."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Bruat, "I have not yet condensed it
sufficiently. You see, I know myself; I know the public.
To hold it, to leave something to posterity, to
create a lasting work, one must be intense. To be
intense—that is everything. A hundred pages! That
is too prolix. In my first inspiration I found the true
form for my thought—a form short, precise, chiseled,
straight, fitting the idea like a cuirass; I mean the sonnet.
Oh! if I could recall the marvelous sonnet of my
youth! But it has been abandoned too long. To-day
I will do better. I will put into it my experience, my
life. Could I but live ten years longer, men would
see what fourteen lines could express, and posterity
would know our modern life, so vast, in this poem
so small, as one inhales a subtle essence prisoned in
a diamond."</p>

<p>He lived those ten years, and the story was abandoned
like the novel and the drama; and slowly, letter
by letter, word by word, line by line, was written the
colossal sonnet which was to contain everything.</p>

<p>At ninety-two Ferdinand Octave Bruat lay on his
deathbed.</p>

<p>His faithful friend was at his side, weeping, sobbing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1566">[Pg 1566]</span>
in despair at seeing so high an intelligence laid
so low.</p>

<p>"Weep not, my friend," said Bruat, "weep not. I
die, but my idea dies not with me. I have destroyed
my first sonnet, I have burnt my drama, I have burnt,
one by one, the twenty-seven volumes of my novel:
the ten, then the five, then the two, then the one and
only, then the story. But, at last, I have created my
masterpiece."</p>

<p>"The sonnet! the immortal sonnet! Give it me!
You have not read it to me, but I know that it is a
masterpiece. Give it me; I will publish it. If necessary,
I will ruin myself that it may be written on gold
in letters of diamonds. It merits it, it will dazzle the
world. Give it me!"</p>

<p>"The sonnet! What sonnet?" stammered Bruat,
gasping for breath.</p>

<p>"Your great sonnet!" sighed the friend, who saw the
delirium of death approaching.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, yes, the sonnet, the great sonnet. Too
great, my friend, too long! It must be made more
intense."</p>

<p>"What! have you burnt your last sonnet also?"</p>

<p>"I have found something better. I have found
everything. Modern life, modernity, I hold it, I have
it, I express it. It is not in a sonnet, nor in a quatrain,
nor even in a line, it is—"</p>

<p>His voice grew weaker, became hoarse, wheezy,
lost.</p>

<p>His friend, with bloodshot eyes, gaping mouth,
leaned over the bed to drink in his last word, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1567">[Pg 1567]</span>
word that would give the key to the mystery, the Open
Sesame to art in the future.</p>

<p>"Speak, speak!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Everything in one phrase, everything in one
phrase!" murmured Bruat.</p>

<p>And the old man raised himself up in a paroxysm of
agony. His look was ecstatic. One felt that over the
threshold of death he saw his ideal. He made a terrible
effort to express it, and the wondrous phrase fell
from his lips with his last sigh.</p>

<p>It was, "Bonjour, Monsieur!"</p>

<p><em>Guy de Maupassant, writer of the short
story par excellence, was born at the Château
of Miromesnil in 1850, and died insane at
Paris in 1893. His godfather Flaubert said
of his first story, the "Boule de Suif," which
appeared in a miscellany called "Les Soirées
de Médan": "I consider it a chef-d'oeuvre—that
little story will stay, you may be sure."
De Maupassant was for a few years connected
with the Ministry of Marine and Public Instruction.
Besides his almost perfect short
stories, he has written plays and novels.</em></p>

<p><em>De Maupassant describes himself admirably
in one of his heroes, "armed with an eye that
gathers images, attitudes, manners with the
precision of a camera." His style is calm,
robust, sober, clean-cut, impersonal. "The Bit
of String" and "The Necklace" are two famous
examples of De Maupassant at his best.</em></p>

<p>Along all the roads leading to Goderville the
peasants and their wives were going toward
the town, for it was market-day. The men
walked at an easy pace, the whole body thrown ahead
at each movement of the long, crooked legs, men deformed
by rude labor, by guiding the plow, which
at once forces the right shoulder upward and twists
the waist; by reaping, which spreads the knees, for
solid footing; by all the patient and painful toil of the
country. Their blue blouses, glossy with starch, as
though varnished, ornamented at the neck and wrists
by a simple pattern in white, swelled out round their
bony chests, like captive balloons from which heads,
arms, and legs were protruding.</p>

<p>Some were leading by a cord a cow or calf, and
their wives behind the animals were hastening their
pace by the strokes of branches stripped of their leaves.
The women carried on their arms great baskets, out
of which hung, here and there, heads of chickens or
ducks. They walked with shorter steps than their
husbands, and at a more rapid pace, spare, erect and
wrapped in scant shawls pinned across their flat chests,
their heads enveloped in white linen drawn closely
over the hair and surmounted by a bonnet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1572">[Pg 1572]</span></p>
<p>Now a pleasure wagon passed at a jerky pony trot,
shaking fantastically two men seated side by side, and
a woman at the back of the vehicle, holding on to its
sides to soften the hard jolts.</p>

<p>In the square of Goderville was a crowd—a jam of
mingled human beings and beasts. The horns of cattle,
the high hats of the rich farmers and the head-dresses
of the women, emerged from the surface of
the assembly; and discordant voices, clamorous, bawling,
kept up a continuous and savage babel, overtopped
now and then by a shout from the robust lungs of a
merry countryman, or the lowing of a cow attached to
the wall of a house. All this mass was redolent of the
stable and soilure, of milk, of hay, of sweat, and diffused
that rank, penetrating odor, human and bestial,
peculiar to people of the fields.</p>

<p>Master Hauchecorne of Bréauté had just arrived at
Goderville, and was going toward the square when he
saw on the ground a bit of string. Master Hauchecorne,
economist, like every true Norman, thought
anything that might be of use worth picking up, and
he bent down painfully, for he suffered from rheumatism.
He took up the piece of string, and was winding
it carefully, when he noticed Malandin, the harness-maker,
watching him from his doorway. The
two men had long ago had a quarrel about a halter,
and both being vindictive, had remained unfriendly.
Hauchecorne was seized with a kind of shame, at thus
being seen by his enemy picking a bit of twine out of
the mud. He quickly hid his prize under his blouse,
then in his breeches pocket; then he pretended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1573">[Pg 1573]</span>
search the ground again for something which he did
not find, and he went off toward the market, his head
in advance, bent double by his infirmities.</p>

<p>He was forthwith lost in the noisy, shuffling crowd
everywhere in motion from innumerable buyings and
sellings. The peasants examined the cows, went away,
came back, hesitated, always fearful of being outwitted,
never daring to decide, peering into the face
of the vender, endlessly searching to discover the ruse
in the man and the fault in the beast.</p>

<p>The women, putting their great baskets down at
their feet, had drawn out their fowls, which were
lying on the ground, legs bound, eyes wild, combs
scarlet. They listened to offers, held to their prices
unmoved, their faces inscrutable; or suddenly deciding
to accept an offer, cried out to the would-be purchaser
slowly moving away:</p>

<p>"Agreed, Master Hutine; I will give it at your
price."</p>

<p>Then little by little the square emptied, and the
Angelus sounding noon, those who lived too far to
go home dispersed in the various public houses.</p>

<p>At Jourdain's the great dining-room was full of
feasters, as the vast court was full of vehicles of every
pedigree—carts, gigs, tilburies, pleasure vans, carioles
innumerable, yellow with mud, mended, out of order,
lifting to heaven their shafts, like two arms, or nosing
the ground, rear in the air.</p>

<p>Opposite the tables of diners the great chimney-piece,
full of bright flame, threw a lively warmth on
the backs of the row at the right. Three spits were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1574">[Pg 1574]</span>
turning, weighted with chickens, pigeons, and legs of
mutton, and a delectable odor of roast flesh and of
juice streaming over its golden brown skin, escaped
from the hearth, put every one in gay humor, and
made mouths water. All the aristocracy of the plow
dined there with Master Jourdain, innkeeper and horse-dealer,
a shrewd fellow, who had his dollars.</p>

<p>The platters were passed and emptied as were the
tankards of yellow cider. Each one talked of his
affairs, his purchases, his sales. The harvest was discussed.
The weather was good for grass, but a little
sharp for grain.</p>

<p>All at once the drum sounded in the court before
the house. All save a few indifferent fellows were
quickly on their feet, and running to the door or the
windows, their mouths full, their napkins in their
hands.</p>

<p>When he had finished his roulade the public crier
held forth in a jerky voice, cutting his phrases at
the wrong place:</p>

<p>"It is made known to the inhabitants of Goderville
and in general to all—the people present at market,
that there was lost this morning, on the Benzeville
road between—nine and ten o'clock, a wallet containing
five hundred francs and important papers. You
are asked to return—it to the town hall, without delay,
or to the house of Master Fortuné Houlebrèque, of
Manneville. There will be twenty francs reward."</p>

<p>Then the crier went on. One heard once more far
off the muffled beating of his drum, and his voice enfeebled
by the distance. Then they all began to talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1575">[Pg 1575]</span>
of the event, estimating Master Houlebrèque's chances
of finding or not finding his wallet.</p>

<p>And the meal went on.</p>

<p>They were finishing their coffee when the chief of
police appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"Where is Master Hauchecorne of Bréauté?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Hauchecorne, seated at the farther end of the table,
replied:</p>

<p>"I'm here."</p>

<p>The chief proceeded:</p>

<p>"Master Hauchecorne, will you have the kindness to
accompany me to the town hall? The mayor wishes
to speak with you."</p>

<p>The countryman, surprised and disquieted, emptied
at a draft his little glass of rum, arose, and, still more
bent than in the morning, for the first movement after
each relaxation was particularly difficult, he set out,
repeating:</p>

<p>"I'm here, I'm here."</p>

<p>And he followed the chief.</p>

<p>The mayor was waiting for him, seated in his fauteuil.
He was the notary of the vicinity, a big, solemn
man, of pompous phrases.</p>

<p>"Master Hauchecorne," said he, "you were seen to
pick up, on the Benzeville road, this morning, the
wallet lost by Master Houlebrèque, of Manneville."</p>

<p>The peasant, astonished, looked at the mayor, frightened
already, without knowing why, by this suspicion
which had fallen on him.</p>

<p>"What! what! I picked up the wallet?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1576">[Pg 1576]</span></p>

<p>"Yes; you yourself."</p>

<p>"Word of honor, I didn't even know of it."</p>

<p>"You were seen."</p>

<p>"Seen? What? Who saw me?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Malandin, the harness-maker."</p>

<p>Then the old man remembered, understood, reddened
with anger.</p>

<p>"He saw meh, th' lout? He saw meh pick up that
string! See here, m'sieu mayor," and feeling in the
bottom of his pocket, he drew out the bit of cord.</p>

<p>But the mayor, incredulous, shook his head.</p>

<p>"You won't make me believe, Master Hauchecorne,
that Malandin, who is a man worthy of credence, took
that thread for a wallet."</p>

<p>The peasant, furious, raised his hand, spit, to attest
his innocence, and declared:</p>

<p>"Yet it's the truth of God, the sacred truth, m'sieu
mayor. On my soul and my salvation, I repeat it."</p>

<p>The mayor continued:</p>

<p>"After picking up the object you went on searching
in the mud a long time to see if some piece of money
mightn't have escaped you."</p>

<p>The old man gasped with indignation and fear.</p>

<p>"May one tell—may one tell lies like that to injure
an honest man? May one say—"</p>

<p>His protest was vain. He was not believed. He
was confronted with Monsieur Malandin, who repeated
and sustained his former affirmation. For an
hour the two men hurled insults at each other.
Hauchecorne was searched, at his demand, and nothing
was found on him. Finally the mayor, greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1577">[Pg 1577]</span>
perplexed, sent him away, warning him that he should
inform the council and await orders.</p>

<p>The news spread. When he came out of the town
hall the old man was surrounded and questioned with
a curiosity serious or mocking, but with no ill-will
in it.</p>

<p>He began to recount the story of the string, but
no one believed him—they only laughed.</p>

<p>He went on, stopped by everybody, stopping his
acquaintances, beginning anew his tale and his protestations,
turning his pockets inside out to prove that
he had nothing.</p>

<p>"Move on, old quibbler," they said to him.</p>

<p>And he became angry, exasperated, feverish, sick
at heart, at not being believed. He did not know
what to do, but told his story over and over.</p>

<p>Night came. It was time to go home. He set out
with three of his neighbors, to whom he pointed out
the place where he had picked up the bit of cord, and
all the way home he talked of his adventure. In the
evening he made a circuit of the village of Bréauté
to tell it to everybody. He met only incredulity.
He was ill all night from his trouble.</p>

<p>The next day, toward one o'clock in the afternoon,
Marius Paumelle, a farm hand, of Ymanville, returned
the wallet and its contents to Monsieur
Houlebrèque, of Manneville. The man stated, in
effect, that he had found the wallet in the road,
but not knowing how to read, had taken it home to
his employer.</p>

<p>The news spread all about. Master Hauchecorne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1578">[Pg 1578]</span>
was told of it. He at once set out again on his travels,
and began to narrate his story, completed by the dénouement.
He was triumphant.</p>

<p>"It's not the thing 'at grieved me most, you understand,"
he said, "but it's the lie. Nothing harms you
like being charged with a lie."</p>

<p>All day long he talked of his adventure. He told
it on the streets to men passing, in the taverns to men
drinking, after church the next Sunday. He stopped
strangers to tell it to them. Now he was tranquil,
yet something half disturbed him, without his knowing
exactly what. People had an amused air as
they listened to him. They did not appear convinced.
He thought he detected whispers behind
his back.</p>

<p>Tuesday of the following week he betook himself
to the market of Goderville, driven there by the need
of exploiting his case. Malandin, standing in his doorway,
began to laugh when he saw him passing. Why?
He accosted a farmer of Criquetot, who did not let
him finish, but giving him a blow in the pit of the
stomach, cried in his face:</p>

<p>"Go your way, humbug!"</p>

<p>Master Hauchecorne was dumfounded, and more
and more ill at ease. Why had he been called a
humbug?</p>

<p>When he was seated at table in Jourdain's inn he
again began to explain the affair. A jockey of Montivilliers
cried to him:</p>

<p>"Come, come, old croaker, I know about your
string!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1579">[Pg 1579]</span></p>

<p>Hauchecorne stammered:</p>

<p>"But since it is found—the wallet?"</p>

<p>The other answered:</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, father. One finds, another
returns. I know nothing about it, but I implicate
you."</p>

<p>The peasant was left choking. He understood at
last. He was accused of having returned the wallet
through an accomplice. He tried to protest. The
whole table began to laugh. He could not finish his
dinner, and went out in the midst of mockeries.</p>

<p>He returned home, ashamed and disgraced, strangling
with rage and confusion, so much the more overwhelmed,
in that he was capable, with his Norman
duplicity, of doing the very thing of which he was
accused, and even boasting of it as a good stroke.
Confusedly he saw his innocence impossible to prove,
his chicanery being well known, and he felt himself
cut to the heart by the injustice of the suspicion.</p>

<p>Then he commenced again to recount his adventure,
lengthening each day his story, adding each time new
reasonings, more energetic protestations, more solemn
oaths, which he invented and arranged in his hours
of solitude, his mind occupied solely with the story of
the string. He was believed the less in proportion to
the complication of his defense and the subtlety of his
argument.</p>

<p>"That's the reasoning of a liar," they said behind
his back.</p>

<p>He felt it, spent himself, wore his life out in useless
efforts. He wasted away visibly. Wags now made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1580">[Pg 1580]</span>
him tell "the string" for their amusement, as one
makes a soldier who has fought recount his battle.
His mind, harassed and unsettled, grew feeble.</p>

<p>Toward the end of December he took to his bed.
He died early in January, and in the delirium of his
agony he attested his innocence, repeating:</p>

<p>"A little string ... a little string ... wait, here
it is, m'sieu mayor!"</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE NECKLACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="center p1 big1">BY GUY DE MAUPASSANT</p>


<p class="center p2b">Translated by Mathilde Weissenhorn.<br> Copyright, 1898, by The Current Literature
Publishing Company.</p>



<p>She was one of those charming girls, born by a
freak of destiny in a family of toilers. She had
no fortune, no expectations, no means of satisfying
her ambitions, except by a marriage with a
rich and distinguished man, and, as she knew none,
in order to escape from her surroundings, she married
a clerk in the office of the Minister of Public
Instruction.</p>

<p>She dressed simply, because she had no means of
adornment; but she was as unhappy as though she had
fallen from a high social position, for the women who
have neither caste nor race use their beauty, grace, and
charm as stepping-stones to those heights from which
they are otherwise barred, their natural tact and instinctive
elegance and quick perceptions being their
only inheritance, and, skilfully used, make them the
equal of their more fortunate sisters. She suffered
incessantly when she glanced around her humble home,
and felt the absence of all those delicacies and luxuries
which are enjoyed only by the rich. In short, all the
little nothings, that another woman of her caste would
not have seen, tortured and wounded her. The sight
of the old Breton peasant woman who performed her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1582">[Pg 1582]</span>simple household duties awakened in her vain longings
and troubled dreams.</p>

<p>She dreamed of beautiful halls, discreetly lighted by
candles in great bronze candlesticks, whose rich carpets
gave back no sounds and whose walls were covered
with silks from the Orient, and of obsequious
footmen half asleep in their large armchairs, ready to
attend to your every want at a moment's notice; of
large salons draped in ancient silks; of "étagers" covered
with priceless bric-à-brac. She thought also of
coquettish small salons, made expressly for the "five
o'clock," when one receives only one's intimates or
distinguished men of letters, from whom it is every
woman's ambition to receive attentions.</p>

<p>When she was seated at the table (whose cloth had
already done duty for three days) or opposite her husband—who
evinced his entire satisfaction with the evening's
repast by such exclamations as: "Oh, the good
'pot-au-feu'! I know nothing better!"—her imagination
carried her away to stately banquet halls, whose
walls were covered with rich tapestries, portraying
scenes in which ancient personages and strange birds
were pictured in the middle of a fairy-like forest. She
pictured the glittering silver, strange dishes, exquisitely
served on marvelous plate, and gallantries whispered
and listened to with the sphinx-like smile with
which a woman of the world knows so well how to
conceal her emotions, all the while eating a rosy trout
or dallying with a wing of a lark. She had no toilets,
no jewels, and it was for these things that she longed,
as the fleet Arabian longs for his native desert. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1583">[Pg 1583]</span>
pleasure to have pleased, been envied, to be seductive
and sought after!</p>

<p>She had a rich friend, a comrade from the convent,
whom she no longer visited, because she suffered from
seeing the things she could not have, and on returning
wept whole days for grief, regret, despair, and
distress.</p>

<p>One evening her husband came home radiant, holding
in his hand a large envelope.</p>

<p>"See," said he, "here is something for you."</p>

<p>She nervously tore open the envelope, drew out a
card, on which these words were printed:</p>

<p>"The Minister of Public Instruction and Madame
Georges Ramponeau beg the honor of the company of
Monsieur and Madame Loisel for the evening of Monday,
January 18th."</p>

<p>Instead of being wild with delight, as he had expected,
she threw the invitation on the table, with an
exclamation of disgust, saying sullenly:</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do with that?"</p>

<p>"But, my dear, I thought you would be so pleased.
You never go out, and this is an event. I only obtained
it after infinite trouble. Everybody wants one;
they are much sought after, and they are not generally
given to employees. You will see there all of
the official world."</p>

<p>She looked at him with supreme disdain, and said
impatiently:</p>

<p>"What would you like me to wear?" The secret
was out. Manlike, he had not thought of that.</p>

<p>"But—the dress—that you wear to the theatre,"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1584">[Pg 1584]</span>
stammered he. "You always look beautiful to me in
that."</p>

<p>He stopped speaking, stupefied and dismayed on seeing
his wife in tears. Two large tears trickled slowly
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? What is the matter?" asked
he tenderly. By violent effort she conquered her grief
and calmly said, while wiping her humid cheeks:</p>

<p>"Nothing; only I have no toilet, and, of course, can
not go. Give the card to one of your comrades whose
wife is fortunate enough to have something suitable
for the occasion."</p>

<p>Despairingly he said:</p>

<p>"See, Mathilde, how much will a dress cost to wear
to this ball; one which can also be used for other occasions—something
very simple."</p>

<p>She reflected a few moments, figuring in her own
mind the sum she could ask without danger of immediate
refusal and frightening her economical husband.
Finally she hesitatingly said:</p>

<p>"I do not know exactly; but it seems to me I might
manage with about 400 francs."</p>

<p>He paled a little, because he had been saving just
that sum to buy a gun for the following summer, when
he would go with some of his friends to the plains
of Nanterre on Sundays to shoot larks. Stifling his
regrets, however, he replied:</p>

<p>"Very well, I will give you 400 francs, but try to
have a beautiful dress."</p>

<p>The day of the fête drew near; but Madame Loisel
seemed sad, anxious, and uneasy. Her toilet was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1585">[Pg 1585]</span>
ready, what could it be? Her husband said to her
one evening:</p>

<p>"What is the matter? You have been so queer for
the last few days!"</p>

<p>She replied: "It worries me that I have not one
jewel, not a precious stone to wear. What a miserable
figure I shall be! I think I would rather not go
at all!"</p>

<p>"You can wear natural flowers; it is all the rage at
this season, and for ten francs you can have two or
three magnificent roses."</p>

<p>But she was not convinced.</p>

<p>"No; there is nothing more humiliating than to be
poorly dressed among so many rich women."</p>

<p>"But how silly you are! Go to your friend, Madame
Forestier, and ask her to lend you her jewels. You are
friendly enough with her to do that."</p>

<p>She gave a cry of joy.</p>

<p>"Yes; that is true—I had not thought of it."</p>

<p>The following day she went to her friend and explained
her predicament. Madame Forestier went to
a closet and took out a large casket, and, opening it,
said:</p>

<p>"Choose, my dear; they are at your service."</p>

<p>She saw first bracelets, then a necklace of pearls, a
Venetian cross, gold and precious stones of exquisite
workmanship. She tried them on before the glass,
unable to decide whether to wear them or not.</p>

<p>"Have you nothing else?" said she.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; look them over, I don't know what might
please you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1586">[Pg 1586]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly she opened a black satin case, disclosing
to view a superb rivière of diamonds, her heart
beat furiously with the desire of possession. She took
them in her trembling hands and put them on over her
simple high-neck gown, and stood lost in an ecstasy of
admiration of herself. Then, fearfully, hesitatingly,
dreading the agony of a refusal:</p>

<p>"Can you lend me only that?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly; if it pleases you."</p>

<p>She fell on her friend's neck, embraced her tempestuously,
and then left hastily with her treasure.</p>

<p>The day of the ball arrived. Madame Loisel was a
success. Among all the beautiful women she was the
most beautiful, elegant, gracious, and smiling with
joy. She attracted the attention of some of the
most distinguished men present, and on all sides was
heard:</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>All the attachés of the cabinet sought her dancing
card eagerly, and even the Minister himself expressed
his approval. She danced with pleasure, thinking of
nothing but the triumph of her beauty and the glory
of her success. Intoxicated by all the admiration, she
seemed to float through a cloud of happiness, intensified
by her complete victory and the tribute paid to
her charms, so sweet to the hearts of women. She
left about four o'clock in the morning; her husband
had slept since midnight in a small room, deserted
except by two or three gentlemen who also awaited
their wives.</p>

<p>He threw over her shoulders the modest cloak which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1587">[Pg 1587]</span>
she had brought, whose shabbiness seemed to mock the
elegance of the ball toilet. She felt the incongruity,
and walked swiftly away in order not to be seen by
those whose rich furs were more in accordance with
the occasion.</p>

<p>"Wait," said her husband, "you will take cold; I
will call a carriage."</p>

<p>But she heeded him not, and rapidly descended the
staircase. When they reached the street, there was no
carriage in sight, and they were obliged to look for
one, calling to the drivers who passed by, but in vain.
Shiveringly they walked toward the Seine and finally
found on the quay one of those nocturnal coupés one
finds only in Paris after dark, hovering about the great
city like grim birds of prey, who conceal their misery
during the day. It carried them to their door (Rue
de Martyrs), and they slowly and sadly entered their
small apartments. It was ended for her, and he only
remembered that he would have to be at his desk at
ten o'clock.</p>

<p>She took off her cloak in front of the glass in order
to admire herself once more in all her bravery, but,
suddenly, she cried out: "The diamonds are gone!"
Her husband, almost half asleep, started at the cry and
asked:</p>

<p>"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>She turned toward him with a frightened air.</p>

<p>"I—I have lost Madame Forestier's necklace!"</p>

<p>He rose dismayed.</p>

<p>"What—how! But it is not possible!" And they
immediately began to search in the folds of the dress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1588">[Pg 1588]</span>
the cloak, in the pockets—everywhere, and found
nothing.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that you had it when you left the
ball?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I felt it while still in the vestibule at the
Minister's."</p>

<p>"But if you had lost it in the street we should have
heard it drop. It ought to be in the carriage."</p>

<p>"Yes; it is possible. Did you take the number?"</p>

<p>"No; and you have not looked at it, either?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>They looked at each other fearfully; finally Loisel
dressed himself.</p>

<p>"I shall go over the whole ground that we traveled
on foot, to see whether I can not find it."</p>

<p>He went out. She sat still in her brilliant ball toilet;
no desire to sleep, no power to think, all swallowed up
in the fear of the calamity which had fallen upon them.</p>

<p>Her husband came in at seven o'clock. He had
found nothing. He had been to the Prefecture of the
Police, to the papers offering a reward, to all small
cab companies, anywhere, in short, where he could
have the shadow of hope of recovery.</p>

<p>She waited all day in the same state of fear in the
face of this frightful disaster.</p>

<p>Loisel returned in the evening pallid and haggard.
No news as yet.</p>

<p>"You must write to your friend that you have
broken the clasp of the necklace and are having it
repaired. That will give us time to look around."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1589">[Pg 1589]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At the end of the week they had lost all hope, and
Loisel, to whom it seemed this care and trouble had
added five years to his age, said:</p>

<p>"We must try and replace the jewels."</p>

<p>The following day they went to the jeweler whose
name was stamped inside the case. He consulted his
books: "I did not sell that necklace, madame, I only
furnished the case."</p>

<p>Then they went from jeweler to jeweler, racking
their memories to find the same, both of them sick
with grief and agony. At last, in a small shop in the
Palais Royal, they found one which seemed to them
like the one they had lost. With beating hearts they
asked the price.</p>

<p>Forty thousand francs; but they could have it for
36,000 francs.</p>

<p>They asked the jeweler not to dispose of it for three
days, and he also promised to take it back at 34,000
francs if the first one was found before the end of
February.</p>

<p>Loisel had inherited 18,000 francs from his father.
He borrowed the rest.</p>

<p>He borrowed a thousand francs from one, five hundred
from another, five louis here, five louis there—he
gave notes, made ruinous engagements, had recourse
to the usurers, ran the whole gamut of money-lenders.
He compromised his whole existence risking
his signature, without knowing that it would be honored,
terrified by the agony of the future, by the black
misery which enveloped him, by the prospect of all the
physical privations and moral tortures. He went for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1590">[Pg 1590]</span>
the new necklace and deposited on the counter his
36,000 francs.</p>

<p>When Madame Loisel returned the necklace to Madame
Forestier, she coldly said:</p>

<p>"You should have returned it sooner, as I might
have needed it."</p>

<p>She did not open the case, the one thing Madame
Loisel had dreaded. What if she had discovered the
change—what would she have thought? Would she
not be taken for a thief?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>From that time on Madame Loisel knew what life
meant to the very poor in all its phases. She took
her part heroically. This frightful debt must be paid.
Her share of privations was bravely borne. They discharged
their one domestic, changed their location, and
rented smaller apartments near the roof.</p>

<p>She knew now what meant the duties of the household,
the heavy work of the kitchen. Her pretty hands
soon lost all semblance of the care of bygone days.
She washed the soiled linen and dried it in her room.
She went every morning to the street with the refuse
of the kitchen, carrying the water, stopping at each
flight of stairs to take breath—wearing the dress of
the women of the people; she went each day to the
grocer, the fruiterer, the butcher, carrying her basket
on her arm, bargaining, defending cent by cent her
miserable money.</p>

<p>They were obliged each month to pay some notes
and renew others in order to gain time. Her husband
worked in the evening balancing the books of merchants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1591">[Pg 1591]</span>
and often was busy all night, copying at five
cents a page.</p>

<p>And this life they endured for ten years.</p>

<p>At the end of this time they had paid all the tax of
the usurers and compound interest.</p>

<p>Madame Loisel seemed an old woman now. She
had become strong and hardy as the women of the
provinces, and with tousled head, short skirts, red
hands, she was foremost among the loud-voiced women
of the neighborhood, who passed their time gossiping
at their doorsteps.</p>

<p>But sometimes when her husband was at his office
she seated herself at the window and thought of that
evening in the past and that ball, where she had been
so beautiful and so admired.</p>

<p>What would have happened if she had not lost
the necklace? Who knows? Life is a singular and
changeable thing, full of vicissitudes. How little it
takes to save or wreck us!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One Sunday as she was walking in the Champs
Elysées to divert herself from the cares and duties of
the week she suddenly perceived a lady, with a little
child, coming toward her. It was Madame Forestier,
still young, beautiful and charming. Madame Loisel
stopped short, too agitated to move. Should she
speak to her? Yes, certainly. And now that the
necklace was paid for she would tell her everything.
Why not?</p>

<p>She walked up to her and said: "Good day, Jeanne."</p>

<p>Madame Forestier did not recognize her and seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1592">[Pg 1592]</span>
astonished at being spoken to so familiarly by this
woman of the people.</p>

<p>"But—madame—I do not—I think you are mistaken."</p>

<p>"No; I am Mathilde Loisel."</p>

<p>"Oh!—my poor Mathilde, how you are changed!"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have had lots of trouble and misery since
last I saw you—and all for you."</p>

<p>"For me! And how was that?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember the necklace of diamonds you
lent me, to wear to the Minister's ball?"</p>

<p>"Yes; well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I lost it."</p>

<p>"Lost it! How could you, since you returned it
to me?"</p>

<p>"I returned you one just like it, and for ten years
we have been paying for it. You know, it was not
easy for us, who had nothing—but it is finished, and
I am very happy."</p>

<p>"You say that you bought a necklace of diamonds
to replace mine," said Madame Forestier.</p>

<p>"Yes; and you never found it out! They were so
much alike," and she smiled proudly.</p>

<p>Touched to the heart, Madame Forestier took the
poor, rough hands in hers, drawing her tenderly toward
her, her voice filled with tears:</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor Mathilde! But mine were false.
They were not worth more than 500 francs at most."</p>

<p><em>Louis Marie Julien Viaud, known as Pierre
Loti, was born at Rochefort in 1850, of an
old Protestant family. He shipped aboard the
"Borda" in 1867, and made many voyages to
India and elsewhere in the East. This young
naval officer was so modest and retiring that
his comrades called him "Loti," after the name
of a little flower of India which discreetly
hides itself. In 1891 he was elected to the
Academy. His chief works are "Le Marriage
de Loti," 1882, "Madame Chrysanthème," 1887,
"Japoneries d'Automne," "Le Roman d'un
Spahi," etc.</em></p>

<p><em>Loti is an impressionist, a personal psychologist—giving
reflections of the passing show,
fleeting things. "He has an exquisite instinct
for the preservation of whatever is antique
and beautiful—a Pied Piper who draws his
admirers after him whether they will or no."</em></p>

<p><em>"The Wall Opposite" is an exquisite bit of
symbolism, worthy to stand, as it does, in the
same volume with the author's "Papillon de
Mite."</em></p>

in a modest little suite, the mother, the
daughter, and a maternal parent already
quite aged—their aunt and great-aunt—whom they
had come to shelter.</p>

<p>The daughter was still very young, in the fleeting
freshness of her eighteen years, when they were compelled,
after a reverse of fortune, to withdraw there
into the most secluded corner of their ancestral mansion.
The rest of the familiar home, all the bright side
that looked out on to the street, it had become necessary
to let to some profane strangers, who changed
there the aspect of things ancient and obliterated the
cherished associations.</p>

<p>A judicial sale had stripped them of the most luxurious
furniture of other days, and they had arranged
their new little salon of recluses with objects a little
incongruous: relics of ancestors, old things brought to
light from the garret, the reserves of the house. But
they fell in love with it at once, this salon so humble,
which must now for years to come, on winter evenings,
reunite all three around the same fire and around
the same lamp. One found it comfortable there; it
had an air cozy and intimate. One felt a little cloistered
there, it is true, but without melancholy, for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1596">[Pg 1596]</span>windows, draped with simple muslin curtains, looked
out on to a sunny court, whose walls, 'way at this
farther end, were adorned with honeysuckle and roses.</p>

<p>And already were they forgetting the comfort, the
luxury of other times, happy in their modest salon,
when one day a communication was brought to them
which left them in mournful consternation: the neighbor
was about to raise his apartment two stories; a
wall was going to rise there, in front of their windows,
to steal away the air, to hide the sun.</p>

<p>And no means, alas! to turn aside that misfortune,
more intimately cruel to their spirits than all the preceding
disasters of fortune. To buy that house from
their neighbor, a thing that had been easy at the time
of their past affluence, was no longer to be dreamed
of! Nothing to do, in their poverty, but to bow their
heads.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And so the stories began to mount, line upon line;
with anxiety they watched them grow; a silence of
grief reigned among them, in the little salon, the depth
of their melancholy measured day by day by the height
of that obscuring object. And to think that that thing
there, higher and still higher, would soon replace the
background of blue sky or golden clouds, against
which in days gone by the wall of their court trailed
off in its network of branches!</p>

<p>In one month the masons had achieved their work:
it was a glazed surface in freestone, which was next
painted a grayish white, resembling almost a twilight
sky of November, perpetually opaque, unchangeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1597">[Pg 1597]</span>
and dead; and in the summers following the rose
trees, the bushes of the court, took on their green again
more palely in its shadow.</p>

<p>Into the salon the warm suns of June and July still
penetrated, but more laggardly in the morning, fleeing
more hurriedly in the evening; the twilights of autumn
fell one hour earlier, bringing abruptly down the dull,
chill melancholy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And the times, the months, the seasons, passed.
Between daylight and darkness, at the undecided
hours of evening, when the three women left off one
after the other their work of embroidery or sewing
before lighting the evening lamp, the young daughter—who
would soon be no longer young—lifted her
eyes ever toward the wall, set up there in place of her
sky of yesterday; often, even, in a sort of melancholy
childishness that constantly returned to her like the
sick fancy of a prisoner, she amused herself in watching
from a certain place the branches of the rose trees,
the tops of the bushes detach themselves in relief
against the grayish background of the painted stones,
and sought to give herself the illusion that the background
there was a sky, a sky lower and nearer than
the real one—after the manner of those who at night
hang upon the deformed visions of dreams.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They had in expectation a heritage of which they
often spoke around their lamp and their work-table,
as of a day-dream, as of a fairy tale, so far away it
seemed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1598">[Pg 1598]</span></p>

<p>But, as soon as they possess it, that accession from
America, at no matter what price, the house of the
neighbor shall be bought in order to pull down all that
new part, to reestablish things as in times past, and to
restore to their court, to restore to their cherished rose
bushes of the high walls, the sun of other times. To
throw it down, that wall, this had become their sole
earthly desire, their continual obsession.</p>

<p>And the old aunt was accustomed to say at such
times:</p>

<p>"My dear daughters, may God grant that I live long
enough, even I, to see that happy day!"</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It tarried long in coming, that heritage.</p>

<p>The rains, and time, had traced on that glazed
surface a sort of blackish stripes, melancholy, melancholy
to look at, formed like a V, or like the
trembling silhouette of a hovering bird. And the
young girl contemplated that wearily every day,
every day.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Once, in a very warm springtime, which, in spite
of the shadow of the wall, made the roses more advanced
than usual, and more spreading, a young man
appeared at the farther end of that court, took his place
for several evenings at the table of the three ladies
without fortune. Passing through the village, he had
been recommended by some friends in common, not
without <em>arrière-pensée</em> of marriage. He was handsome,
with a high-spirited face, browned by the great
blowings of the seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1599">[Pg 1599]</span></p>

<p>But he judged it too chimerical, that heritage; he
found her too poor, the young girl, in whom, besides,
the color began to fade for lack of sunlight.</p>

<p>So he departed, without return, he who had represented
there for a time the sun, energy, and life. And
she who already looked upon herself as his fiancée received
from that departure a dumb and secret feeling
as of death.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And the monotonous years continued their march,
like the impassive rivers; there passed five; there
passed ten, fifteen, even twenty. The freshness of
the young girl without fortune finished little by little
by fading away, useless and disdained; the mother
took on some gray hairs; the old aunt became infirm,
shaking her head, octogenarian in a faded armchair,
forever seated at the same place, near the darkened
window, her venerable profile cut out against the
foliage of the court below that background of
glazed wall where the blackish marbling accentuated
itself in the form of a bird, traced by the sluggish
gutters.</p>

<p>In the presence of the wall, of the inexorable wall,
they grew old all three. And the rose bushes, the
shrubs, grew old, too, with the less ominous age of
plants, with their airs of rejuvenation at each return
of spring.</p>

<p>"Oh! my daughters, my poor daughters," said the
aunt continually in her broken voice that no longer
finished the phrase, "provided I live long enough,
even I."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1600">[Pg 1600]</span></p>

<p>And her bony hand, with a movement of menace,
indicated that oppressive thing of stone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She had been dead a twelvemonth, leaving a dreadful
void in that little salon of recluses, and they had
wept over her as the most cherished of grandmothers,
when at last the inheritance came, very upsetting, one
day when they had ceased longer to think of it.</p>

<p>The aged daughter—forty years struck now—found
herself quite young in her joy at entering into possession
of the returned fortune.</p>

<p>They drove out the lodgers, you may be sure, they
reestablished themselves as before; but by preference
they kept themselves ordinarily in the little salon of
the days of moderate means: in the first place it was
now full of souvenirs, and then besides it was again
taking on a sunny cheerfulness, since they were to
throw down that imprisoning wall which was to-day
no more than a vain scarecrow, so easy to destroy by
touch of louis d'or.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It took place at last, that downfall of brick and
mortar, longed for during twenty gloomy years. It
took place in April, at the moment of the first balmy
airs of the first long evenings. Very quickly it was
accomplished, in the midst of the noise of falling
stones, of singing workmen, in a cloud of plaster and
of ancient dust.</p>

<p>And at twilight of the second day, when the work
was finished, the workmen gone, silence returned, they
found themselves once more sitting at their table, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1601">[Pg 1601]</span>
mother and the daughter, bewildered at seeing so
clearly, at having need no longer of the lamp to begin
their evening meal. Like a formal visit from familiar
days gone by, they contemplated the rose bushes
of their court spread out once more against the sky.
But instead of the joy they had looked forward to
there was at first an indefinable uneasiness: too much
light all at once in their little salon, a sort of melancholy
splendor, and the feeling of an unaccustomed
void out of doors, of limitless change. No words there
came to them in presence of the accomplishment of
their dream; rapt, the one and the other, held by an
ever-increasing melancholy, they remained there
without talking, without touching the waiting meal.
And little by little, their two hearts pressing still
closer, that grew to be a kind of grief, like one of
those regrets, dull and without hope, which the
dead leave us.</p>

<p>When the mother, at length, perceived that the eyes
of her daughter began to grow faded with crying,
divining the unexpressed thoughts which must so perfectly
resemble her own: "It can be built up again,"
she says. "It seems to me they can try, can they not,
to make it the same again?"</p>

<p>"I, too, thought of that," replied the daughter. "But
no, don't you see: <em>it would never be the same</em>!"</p>

<p>Mon Dieu! was it possible that such a thing could
be; it was she, the very same, who had decreed it, the
annihilation of that background of a familiar picture,
below which, during one springtime, she had seen in
high relief a certain fine face of a young man, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1602">[Pg 1602]</span>
during so many winters the venerable profile of an old
aunt dead.</p>

<p>And all at once, at recollection of that vague design
in the form of the shadow of a bird, traced there by
patient gutters, and which she would see again never,
never, never, her heart was suddenly torn in a manner
most pitiable; she wept the most melancholy tears of
her life before the irreparable destruction of that wall.</p>

<p><em>Paul Bourget presents the greatest possible
contrast to Anatole France. His style is involved,
sentence is fitted into sentence, clothed
like Henry James, and altogether un-French.
Bourget's psychology, though penetrating, seems
rather to clothe his characters than to create
them, consequently his novels are long psychological
treatises. It was a delight, therefore,
to come upon this tale of Bourget's, in which
the story is as absorbing as the psychology.</em></p>

<p><em>Bourget was born at Amiens in 1852, and
began his literary career, as usual, by writing
verses, etc. Besides "Outre Mer," which he
published in 1891 after his visit to America,
his work consists chiefly of novels, "Mensonges,"
"Crime d'Amour," "Le Disciple,"
"Cosmopolis," etc. He was elected a member
of the French Academy in 1894.</em></p>

<p>Alfred Boyer felt very happy that afternoon
over the printer's proofs that the mail had
just brought him. He could not take his
eyes off the page containing the title:</p>

<p>"<em>Mémoires du Maréchal Frédet Prince d'Augsbourg,
Duc d'Ivrea, with notes and introduction
by Alfred Boyer, former student of the École
de Chartres.</em>" The work to which he had devoted
himself during the last two years was nearing completion.
His name was going to be associated for
ever with that of "Catinat of the Grande Armée,"
who had begun as volunteer in 1792, and had died of
a broken heart after Waterloo.</p>

<p>Need one recall Frédet's heroism in the wars in
the North—then too, in the first campaign in Italy,
just under the walls of Ivrea, and his brilliant services
in Egypt and Germany; how after Ulm, he had surrounded
and taken prisoner ten thousand of the enemy
at the gates of Augsbourg, with a handful of hussars?
Austerlitz, Iéna, Eylau, Wagram, and Spain in turn
saw this indefatigable soldier maneuvre his troops with
the skill to which the "Mémoires" bore testimony.
"I sent Frédet to Catalonia," said the Emperor,
"with twenty thousand men. It was like sending
fifty thousand. He alone made up the difference."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1606">[Pg 1606]</span></p>
<p>A very severe wound prevented his joining Napoleon
in Russia, he achieved wonders at Dresden,
though scarcely reestablished in health, and at Leipzig,
where he saved the retreat by checking during several
hours, the main body of the Austrian cavalry. Like
Ney, and like the Emperor himself, he was one of those
who sought death at Waterloo, and whom death would
not accept, in spite of prodigies of valor, exalted
almost to madness by the despair of the defeat.</p>

<p>When peace was concluded, the veteran shut himself
up at Combronde, near Riom, on a small
estate that he had acquired in Auvergne, where he
had been born. It was there where he commenced
to write or rather to dictate his mémoires in a haphazard
fashion, following his exalted fancy, accumulating
a pile of rather incoherent notes, which
had slept in their portfolios for eighty years—from
1821, at which date the old soldier died, until
1900 when his grandson, the present Prince of Augsbourg,
had at last decided to publish those papers,
a little influenced, it must be admitted, by his need of
money. Having a scanty fortune and a very large
family—five marriageable daughters—he had been
tempted by the success of "Marbot's Mémoires." He
summoned from Paris to his little Château of Combes,
where the meagreness of his income and his misanthropy
kept him prisoner the year round, a young man
who was to put in order that mass of documents
mostly without shape. That is how Alfred Boyer
found himself with a task that developed into a passion.
Whatever may be the political value accorded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1607">[Pg 1607]</span>
the Napoleonic legend, its heroic character casts a
magic spell that few historians of that fantastic epoch
have been able to overthrow. That magic spell had
acted so much the more on the young compiler, because
the moral figure of Frédet was fully in accord with
his military bearing. Among the portraits of those
marshals, all equally brilliant, but not equally attractive,
his was one of the most pure and exalted. The
heroism of the Prince of Augsbourg retained to the
last that antique charm that one imagines would have
adorned Desaix had he lived long enough. It seems
that Frédet never had any ambition for these dignities
which his master delighted to shower upon him. When
did he have a chance to enjoy them? Bonaparte, who
knew men and their value, never ceased for a moment
to keep him employed, in peace as well as in war.
When he was not fighting, Frédet was an administrator.
His proverbial integrity, his gentleness, and—a
quality extremely rare in that army sprung from the
Revolution—his religious fervor, gave to his countenance
the look of a paladin. While he lived it was
impossible to come in contact with him without loving
him. He disarmed the envy of Marmont, the sour
humor of Soult, and warmed the coldness of Macdonald.
The writings of these three rivals in glory,
give ample proof of it. Dead, his rare personality
had just performed a similar miracle of seduction
in his memorialist, who gazed as if hypnotized at
the first page of the mémoires, and the bulky package
of proofs. At that very minute he was living over
again the two years of his arduous labor. He saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1608">[Pg 1608]</span>
himself once more, after his thesis had been approved,
hesitating between accepting a poorly paid post as
librarian in an obscure corner of some province, and
the offer that one of his professors had made him,
to work on the mémoires of the famous marshal.
It was food and lodging assured for some time, a
means of becoming known, and of laying aside a few
thousand francs with which he could support himself
until he could obtain appointment to some good post.
Beyond this, Boyer did not know anything about the
soldier whose papers he had to classify.</p>

<p>In that old house at Combes, which had remained
unchanged during three-quarters of a century, he had
commenced to give himself up to that retrospective
semi-hallucination known only to those who have a
scholarly disposition. Taine has pictured it in that
eloquent page, where he describes himself at the archives,
following over the yellowed paper the old
writings of the men of the Revolution. "I was," he
says, "tempted to speak aloud to them." In that
poor mansion where the old hero had sheltered himself
in his last few days, the walls were covered
with relics of his glorious adventures, brought together
in confusion; here, swords of honor hung on the wall,
next to them some engravings representing feats of
arms; there, portraits of the marshal himself, the first
Consul, the Emperor, Frédet's chosen companions,
among others that of Ney, who had been one of
the witnesses to his marriage. Frédet's wife was there,
frail and delicate in her rich costume of a court lady,
painted by Gérard, in an attitude identical with that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1609">[Pg 1609]</span>
of the Duchess of Rovigo, on the edge of a park
leaning on a small column ornamented with helmets
and cuirasses in high relief. She had survived her
husband forty years, and to her piety was due the
preservation of the home to which the eldest son of
the family had not returned until 1875, after having
served in the army and resigned while simple lieutenant-colonel,
when another had—unjustly as he
maintained—been promoted over him. His carelessness
produced at least this advantage, that the species
of family museum brought together through the sorrow
of the grandmother had remained undisturbed.</p>

<p>In the mean while, that is to say, under the monarchy
of July and the Second Empire, the Frédets had lived
in Paris; the second Prince of Augsbourg as a peer
of France, and then as Senator; the third, the present
Prince, as an officer of the staff of Napoleon the Third.
Physically the colonel was the living image of his
illustrious grandfather. He had the leonine face, the
calm and powerful mien, the grave eyes, the serious
mouth, and also the athlete's muscles, broad shoulders
and powerful neck. There the resemblance stopped.
Was it lack of education or opportunity? Did he take
morally after some ancestor on the mother's side?
His father had married a girl of noble birth, but of that
country nobility with whom hunting is the sole hereditary
occupation. In his old age it was the only pleasure
that seemed to survive in this heir to an illustrious
name, the first ambition of a disappointed career.</p>

<p>Alfred Boyer recalled his strange impression during
the first weeks of his sojourn when he saw the Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1610">[Pg 1610]</span>
start out in the early morning, with his gamekeeper
and his dogs and not return until nightfall, covered
with dust or mud, sunburned or else soaked in rain,
according to the weather, his gun on his shoulder, and
his game bag bulging with the pheasants hunted during
the day. To his five daughters, left at home under the
charge of an old aunt, who managed the household for
him, this taciturn hunter seemed to give no thought.</p>

<p>They were pretty and refined girls, and if the memorialist
had not been a poor pale-faced student, his
presence in this isolation with these five young unmarried
girls might not have been without danger. But
Alfred belonged to that class of timid, intellectual men
who have no need of disenchanting experiences to
put in practise the advice the fair Venetian gave so
amusingly to Rousseau: "Avoid women and study
mathematics." Being of a sickly nature, knowing
himself awkward and homely, he had early turned
into intellectual channels the feverish ardor that young
men of his age usually spend in sentimental adventures.
His only pleasures were the discoveries of unpublished
texts, of ingenious hypotheses on obscure
historical points, and the patient conquest of a chair
in the Institute by force of erudite publications. The
marshal's papers fell in well with this program, and
with something more—the poetry of the extraordinary
imperial exploit incarnate in one of the most magnificent
workers. Thus it was that after having engaged
in the work as compiler of records, Alfred Boyer continued
as enthusiast, identifying himself with his hero
in each episode of his brilliant career, collating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1611">[Pg 1611]</span>
smallest anecdotes about him, claiming for him the
first place in all the events in which he had taken part,
putting himself at infinite pains to make this great
man greater still; possessed by one of those retrospective
idolatries at which we can not smile, so disinterested
and pathetic are they when their object is
a name sunk in misfortune and oblivion, like that of
this soldier who had died of the defeat of his master
and of France. What a work it was to decipher the
piles of notes and documents he had left, to make
selection from among the texts, to complete them with
commentaries! But those "Mémoires" were at last to
appear, all the traits of that noble figure were to shine
out in a brilliant light, and the author of this posthumous
justice could not gaze enough on the printed
characters that would soon shine forth in the cover of
the first volume—the complete work would be in four
volumes—in the booksellers' shop windows....</p>

<p>The sound of a door opening roused Boyer from
his "semihypnotic"<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> trance. He raised his head and
sprang suddenly to his feet. It was the Prince of
Augsbourg who had just entered the library. Those
visits, rare at first, had become more frequent as
Alfred Boyer's work advanced. Not that the sportsman
had ever ventured to give any advice to the
memorialist, who had read to him some of the pages
dictated or written by his grandfather—those, more
frequently, in which the marshal told of the departure
from his paternal roof (he was the son of a physician
at Combronde), to join the army—the story of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1612">[Pg 1612]</span>first battle in which he had taken part, at Hondschoote—that
of his last, and his farewell to the Emperor
before the charge at Waterloo.</p>

<p>The manner in which he listened to those recitals,
his head in his hands, never uttering a word, revealed
an intense feeling in the hero's descendant. Evidently
an almost religious cult for his ancestor burned in this
obscure and wild nature, which Alfred Boyer pitied
without quite comprehending. He could see that, overburdened
by the weight of a great name, ruined by his
father, discontented with his present circumstances,
and knowing his inability to alter them, the colonel
had fallen into that lethargy of the will in which for
some years he had simply vegetated.</p>

<p>He had given up the society of his set, as well as his
profession, turning countryman, and since his wife's
death had not paid any attention to the small details
in personal appearance that, even in the most ordinary
surroundings, reveal the man who has been used to
good company. It was evident that he loved his
daughters, as proved by the sadness with which his
eyes would sometimes rest on these pretty children,
doomed by their portionless condition to some obscure
marriage in that corner of Auvergne. The remnants
of his fortune yielded an income of about thirty thousand
francs a year. Was that enough to sustain the
rank of a prince?</p>

<p>The colonel had said to himself that decadence
would be better borne in the solitude of this house
peopled with the memories of his grandfather. Thus
he had reasoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1613">[Pg 1613]</span></p>

<p>Or at least that was the solution that Alfred Boyer
had found in his mind to the enigma presented by
that character; and his own constantly increasing cult
for the marshal made him sympathize with the homage
rendered by abdication to that ruinous heritage. The
grandson felt the glory of the grandfather. That was
enough to make the enthusiastic compiler of the
"Mémoires" feel himself in sympathy with his taciturn
patron, and on this occasion he felt keen pleasure
at seeing him enter the library. He would show him the
proofs just arrived by the courier. He welcomed the
newcomer, and, handing to him the proofs, he said:</p>

<p>"I was just going to ask you to receive me, Prince.
Our first volume is printed."</p>

<p>"I do not understand much about these things," replied
the Prince of Augsbourg, after having glanced
at the bundle of proofs, "but all this seems to me very
good." He glanced through them again more slowly,
stopping at certain passages that he recognized, and,
a detail that Alfred was surprised to note, his face
grew visibly more sombre. This made his resemblance
to his grandfather much more striking. One would
have said that to hold in his hand this book, which
was, in a measure, his production since he had kept
the memorialist at work at his own expense during
the past two years, was more than painful to him.
At last he returned the sheets to the young man, saying:
"Yes, that is very good—but perhaps you will
have to add some notes to it. Yes," he continued after
a moment's hesitation, "I received a letter this morning
informing me that certain documents will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1614">[Pg 1614]</span>
placed at my disposal. I shall have to go to Paris
to fetch them. I have come to ask you to accompany
me—Thanks," he went on as Alfred Boyer nodded
assent, "I did not doubt that you would be willing to
come—" He hesitated again, then with an effort he
added: "Doubtless you have heard something about
the Duchesse d'Ivrea."</p>

<p>"The Duchesse d'Ivrea?" repeated the young man.
"I thought that title was one of those belonging to the
Princess of Augsbourg."</p>

<p>"It is borne by the widow of my younger brother,"
interrupted the colonel, who added in a singular tone:
"You are right. All the titles of the family should
belong to the eldest, but my uncle was formerly called
the Duc d'Ivrea, and my brother naturally took the
same title. I am surprised at your not knowing this,
after having been busy with the marshal, as you have,
for almost twenty months. It is true," and a bitter
smile curled his lips, "that, compared with him, we are
scarcely interesting. And then my brother and I had
not visited each other, and I do not know his wife.
That is why I never mentioned her to you. She is
very ill, she informs me—given up by her physicians,
in fact. She wishes to deliver into my hands some
family papers left in her keeping by my brother. I
can rely on you, then. The most interesting part of
them is a correspondence with Moreau during the latter's
sojourn in America. You know that the marshal
made a campaign with him in Holland. He foresaw
his failure and wished to prevent it. These letters
were offered for sale some years ago. They got them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1615">[Pg 1615]</span>
away from me because they were wealthier than I, but
now they wish to return them to me, and it is right
that they should. We should find a place for them in
the second volume. That will mean a great deal of
revising, but it is worth the trouble. I shall leave you
now, as I have many orders to attend to. We shall
start this evening." ...</p>

<p>While making his preparations after this interview,
Alfred Boyer could not shake off an impression, that,
vague as it was and without foundation, seemed to him
a certainty. This visit to his sister-in-law was costing
the Prince very dear. There was a mystery in
their relations, and a very painful one. Whence came
this rupture, and what were its causes, so profound
that not the slightest mention of a Duchess d'Ivrea
had ever been made either by the Prince or by any
of his five daughters? Not one of them bore this
name; they were called simply the Frédets of Augsbourg.
What had happened between the two brothers?
Had this rupture preceded the marriage? Or had that
event been the cause of it?</p>

<p>All these questions presented themselves to the young
man's mind without his having the faintest inkling as to
their solution. During the long months of his sojourn
he had not established relations with any one among the
few country families in the neighborhood of Combes.</p>

<p>Moreover, he would have considered himself unworthy
of the confidence that his patron had shown
him from the very first, opening his archives to him,
letting him live in complete intimacy with his household,
if he had made any inquiries about the Frédets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1616">[Pg 1616]</span>
From the moment that there was a question of some
family secret, to start a conversation on this subject
with the old relative who acted as housekeeper would
have been as impossible as to try and make one of the
young girls talk about it. He knew no more of the
affair when the day after the conversation the Prince
and he arrived in Paris than he did on the preceding
evening. During the journey he had noted the increasing
preoccupation of his companion, who, when
they reached the station, said to him: "I do not know
as yet where we shall put up. Let us take a cab and
we will stop at some lodging-house. I used to know
a place in the Rue de Bourgogne, in the neighborhood
of the Chamber of Deputies. We will be near the Rue
de Grenelle, where our business is. The d'Ivrea house
is the same that the marshal lived in under the Empire."</p>

<p>"Next door to the house of the Duc de Feltré?"
returned Alfred Boyer. "It was only three days ago
that I was transcribing the page on which he relates
their meeting on the sidewalk in front of their houses
on his return from Waterloo, and his refusal to return
the Duc's salutation. How finely the passage concludes:
'Perhaps it was not just,' he writes, 'but at
that time every French officer who had not fought at
Waterloo filled me with horror. I should add that
if the Duc de Feltré deserted us, at least it was not,
as in so many other cases, for money. He was my
friend, and I attest that I have always known him to
be an upright man with clean hands.'</p>

<p>"Upright and with clean hands," repeated the
Prince. "Yes, those were his words; I recall them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1617">[Pg 1617]</span>
too. That might have been his own device, do you
not think so? My brother repurchased the house," he
added after a pause. "I do not know how <em>they</em> have
furnished it, but the façade should not be changed. It
is of the seventeenth century and has the grand style
of that period. You shall judge of it yourself this afternoon,
for I do not intend to remain here long. I count
upon going to the d'Ivrea house in this same cab as
soon as we have engaged our apartment in the Rue
Bourgogne. You will not leave me—I am not paying
a visit to a relative. I have come here to obtain some
papers that belong to me by right as the senior. You
have been good enough to engage your services as
historian for our family until the end of the publication
of the 'Mémoires.' Your place, then, is with me."</p>

<p>They had taken their places in the carriage while the
ex-colonel was thus formulating the program of a proceeding
made the more mysterious by these words, and
by the irrevocable determination that they indicated.</p>

<p>During the three-quarters of an hour that it took
them to reach the Rue de Bourgogne, where the lodging-house
stood, and then the Rue de Grenelle,
they were silent, the Prince absorbed in his thoughts,
and the young man out of respect for a sadness of
which he divined the cause, without being able to determine
its precise nature. The sadness was changed
into an actual contraction of pain when the carriage
stopped in front of a high <em>porte-cochère</em>, above which
could be read this inscription, recently restored, as the
brilliancy of the lettering indicated: "Hôtel d'Ivrea."
Alfred alighted first and waited before the open door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1618">[Pg 1618]</span>
ready to assist the Prince out of the carriage. The
latter did not move. This last effort was almost intolerable
to him.</p>

<p>"I thought at first I should send you in my place, my
dear Boyer," he said, finally deciding to alight, "but
she would not receive you. It is me that she wishes
to see. She has adopted the only way, my veneration
for the marshal. Let us go in—but it is so hard!"</p>

<p>Never in all those weeks that they had lived almost
constantly together had he uttered such intimate sentiments
to his companion. His irritation, which he
scarcely gave himself the trouble to conceal, increased
still more as they crossed the court at the back of
which rose the beautiful gray façade he had spoken of,
with its high windows and its ample mansard roof
pierced with bull's-eyes. Though Alfred Boyer was
much moved by the family tragedy, of which the
Prince's attitude was an index, he could not but admire
the noble aspect of the structure in which the heroic
Frédet had thought to find rest. But if the exterior
of the ancient house harmonized with the legend of the
hero, the interior offered a no less striking contrast to
it. The extraordinary excess of gaudy upholstery, the
multiplicity of trifling ornaments, and the total absence
of real works of art, the petty coquetry of the curtains,
everything from the very entrance stairs and the vestibule
gave an impression of false luxury and cheap
imitation. The walls and ceiling of the salon into
which the two men were shown were draped with blue
satin, the assorted portières were held up by silver-fringed
curtain rings; double curtains of heavy silk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1619">[Pg 1619]</span>
and lace veiled the windows. The sumptuous upholstering
of the furniture utterly lacking in taste, the
overladen garnishment of the mantel capped the climax,
and made of this sumptuous apartment an almost
questionable place. It fairly reeked with orders from
the fashionable draper, of bank bills, and nothing
showed personal taste. The abundance of coronets
scattered everywhere proclaimed the parvenu. That
the woman who ordered such furnishings for the
austere mansion should be the Duchesse d'Ivrea was
one of those paradoxes of fate that amuse only the
unthinking. When one has such a passionate adoration
for a hero as the compiler of the "Mémoires" had
for the Duc d'Ivrea, such antitheses seemed to be
a profanation.</p>

<p>Alfred was not surprised, then, at the visible repugnance
shown in the face of the actual bearer of the
name and arms of the Frédets during the few moments
passed in the salon while they were waiting to be presented.
The Prince had sent word by the servant that
he was there with the gentleman who had charge of
the publication of the marshal's papers.</p>

<p>As if turning his back on this cheap luxury, he had
gone and leaned against the window, from which his
rude hand had roughly pushed aside the flimsy curtains.
He looked out on a narrow garden to which
the first shoots of spring were already giving a touch
of green, and which was vulgarized by a Japanese
kiosk with colored windows. When the servant returned
to the room, Alfred could see that the eyes of
the sturdy hunter were suffused with tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1620">[Pg 1620]</span></p>

<p>"Well?" he demanded almost imperiously. "Madame
la Duchesse is awaiting Monsieur le Prince,"
was the reply, "but alone; she is too ill this morning
to receive two visitors."—"What did I tell you, Boyer!"
exclaimed the Prince, not caring whether or not he
was heard by the footman. "She wants me to come to
pay her a visit, but I have not come with any such intention,
and I will not have it so. I came with you to
obtain the papers. Let her receive you or not in her
bedroom, that is of no importance. You are none the
less here in the house, and officially. Wait for me
here then. It will not be long." Ten minutes later the
irascible nobleman appeared again, holding in his hand
a large sealed envelope, which he displayed, saying:
"It is the first restitution, and the most important for
us: the correspondence with Moreau."</p>

<p>And when they were again in the carriage, rolling
toward the Rue Bourgogne: "I must do her this justice,"
he continued, without giving his sister-in-law her
title, "she was quite correct. I found her in bed. I
had never seen her, as I have already told you. She
has the reputation of having been very beautiful, and
she must have been. Though she is worn by sickness,
she still has fine features and astonishing eyes. She is
dying of cancer of the liver. She knows it; she told
me of it. She returned these papers to me very simply,
saying that on my next visit she would give me other
documents, which she says she must arrange. I am
not her dupe; they are all arranged. She wants to
prove—though I have not the slightest idea to whom—that
the Frédet family recognizes her since the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1621">[Pg 1621]</span>
Prince of Augsbourg goes to her house. But the matter
is done with. I have the packet necessary for our
work. We can start back again for Combes with our
booty this evening or to-morrow, and though it is to
be regretted that some parts of it are lacking, still they
are mere trifles. But let us assure ourselves that we
have not been cheated.</p>

<p>"There were thirty-seven letters, according to the
catalog of the sale at which they bought them. Good,
here we are! we can go upstairs and make sure that
the number is correct. Will you take charge of the
matter and count them carefully? Thirty-seven—"</p>

<p>When they were both in the apartment, consisting of
two little communicating bedrooms, that had been reserved
for them, Alfred Boyer's first action was to
open the envelope, which was fastened with a seal
bearing the escutcheon and device of the Frédets.
His historian's heart beat high as he saw that it was
not merely a matter of simple notes, but of long letters,
some of which covered ten or a dozen pages. He
began to count them, drawing them out of the envelope
one by one.</p>

<p>He was unfolding the fifteenth when he noticed a
smaller envelope, that had been slipped into it. He
took it out and read the direction: "For the Prince of
Augsbourg." The envelope had not been sealed. He
opened it mechanically, thinking that it had some connection
with the correspondence. In it was a sheet of
paper, again with the crest of the Frédets, on which
he read with that swift look that takes in ten lines at
a glance:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1622">[Pg 1622]</span></p>

<p><em>"This is my will, which annuls all preceding ones.
I constitute as my sole legatee Monsieur Jules Frédet,
Prince d'Augsbourg, under the express condition that
he shall personally conduct my funeral, that he shall
have my body as well as that of my husband deposited
in the tomb of the Frédet family, and that I appear as
donor of the letters to General Moreau in the forthcoming
'Mémoires' of the marshal. If Monsieur Jules
Frédet does not accept this legacy, my will deposited
at my notary's shall be valid in place of this. Given
under my hand"</em>—here followed a date and beneath it
the signature: "<em>Duchesse d'Ivrea</em>."</p>

<p>"Is the count correct?" This question, snapped out
by the Prince through the open door from the end of
the other room where he had gone to dress, startled the
young man. Surely he was quite innocent of all design,
and he had no sooner discovered the confidential
nature of the paper than he replaced it in its envelope.
Nevertheless he had discovered its contents, and it was
with cheeks flaming like those of a guilty man that he
replied: "I do not know yet, but I have just found this
in the correspondence." He had on the tip of his
tongue the avowal of his involuntary indiscretion, but
false shame restrained him.</p>

<p>"An envelope?" said the Prince. "Addressed to
me? It must be some trick she has devised to get a
letter to me. If it is a letter I shall tear it up without
reading it. Let me see"—he had advanced to the door
of the room and began reading aloud: "<em>This is my</em>—"</p>

<p class="caption p2b p1b">Paul Bourget</p>
</figure>
</div>


<div class="chapter"><p>He stopped short. He had turned terribly pale.
Alfred saw that his hand clenched over the sheet as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1623">[Pg 1623]</span>if to crush and tear it. Then, folding the paper, he
returned it to its envelope and placed it on the mantel
under a book, as if it were of no importance. He came
back to the door and looked at Alfred, who was already
bent over his work, prudently avoiding this look.
He seemed to have a question on his lips that he did
not put into words. He had stopped while shaving to
call out his question. Without saying anything more
he finished shaving while Boyer continued to arrange
the letters with hands trembling with emotion, and
the same emotion shook his voice as he said, finally
breaking the silence, when the work was done:</p>
</div>

<p>"The thirty-seven letters are here."</p>

<p>"They are all here, eh?" replied the Prince. He
was so upset that he did not notice the young man's
embarrassment. "You need not begin to examine
them until to-morrow morning," he continued. "I
give you leave of absence for this afternoon. You
have not been in Paris for a long time, and you
may have some friends that you wish to look
up here. You are at liberty for the rest of the day,
but come back at about six o'clock to see if I need
you."</p>

<p>He had scarcely reached the sidewalk of the Rue de
Bourgogne, when the young man felt so strongly the
pangs of remorse at not having confessed his indiscretion
that he stood still for several minutes, asking
himself whether he should not at once go upstairs
and tell the Prince that he had read the will. At the
same time he saw that, once in the Prince's presence,
it would again be impossible for him to confess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1624">[Pg 1624]</span></p>

<p>Not that he feared reproaches for the act itself; he
had only done as he had been directed in ascertaining
the contents of the envelope, which, moreover, was
open. His silence afterward was easily explained by
timidity. What now made the avowal so painful was
the knowledge that he had surprised the grandson of
his hero in a moment of mental anguish. The manner
in which the Prince had spoken of his sister-in-law,
his attitude at the d'Ivrea house, his gesture
when he had taken up the envelope, his first words,
then the contraction of his hand over the paper—all
these indications combined to reveal an aversion which
could not arise from a mere family disagreement, such
as is ordinarily dissolved by death, but from a most
intense, a most violent contempt. The silence concerning
her maintained by the family proved that the
aversion was not personal. Why? For what reason
had all the elder branch taken such a stand against the
marriage of the head of the younger branch? Alfred
could no longer doubt that the Duchesse d'Ivrea knew
the disposition of her relatives toward her. The
method she had adopted to send her will to her
brother-in-law sufficiently proved that.</p>

<p>Then why did she make this will? Why should
she leave this fortune unreservedly to relatives for
whom she ought to have a hatred equal to their own?</p>

<p>Suddenly the terms of this will that he had scarcely
looked at—but how could he ever forget its smallest
detail?—recurred to the young man's mind. The
funeral, conducted officially by the Prince, the place
in the family tomb at Père-Lachaise, the name in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1625">[Pg 1625]</span>
"Mémoires" of the marshal—it would be to acknowledge
the relationship and the marriage with the Duc
d'Ivrea, giving a formal revocation to an ostracism
that, doubtless, had lasted many years and exasperated
her womanly pride. The Duchess had placed
the bargain entirely in the Prince's hands. The figure
of the latter actually holding in his hands the paper
that formulated this bargain arose before Alfred's
mind with the clearness of a perfect image, and again
he saw the conflict of the three emotions which his
face had expressed: astonishment, anger, hesitation.</p>

<p>The Prince had hesitated. He hesitated still. Alfred,
who had gone a few steps in the direction of the
Bourbon Palace, stopped a second time to turn back
to his lodgings. For a long time his eyes were fastened
on the windows of the second floor, behind
which a drama of conscience was being enacted of
which he would soon know all the details. As yet
he could only see facts that were of too doubtful a
significance to enable him to form an opinion. "After
all," said he, shrugging his shoulders, "it is none of
my business. It is for the Prince to decide whether
the motives of his antipathy toward his sister-in-law
are stronger than his desire to become rich. The episode
is worth my little trip to Paris; let us profit by it."</p>

<p>Ever since the now distant time when he had exiled
himself in Auvergne until his work should have been
finished, in order not to draw upon his savings, he had
let slip the bonds of friendship that had united him to
many of his comrades in the École de Chartres. Having
no parents to visit, he began to think of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1626">[Pg 1626]</span>
moved thereto, perhaps, by a last remark of his patron.
All at once a face and a name stood out in his memory
with singular distinctness. Was it not in this very
quarter where he now was, in the Rue de l'Université,
that one of his most charming classmates lived, Raymond
de Contay? He was a young man of high birth,
grandson to the famous Duchesse de Contay, who was
so well known for her unbounded charity. After making
an excellent record as student in the same college
with Alfred, and having no desire to be an idler, he
had enrolled himself in the École de Chartres. His
intention had been to devote himself to historical
work.</p>

<p>If Alfred had probed his own motives he would
have recognized the fact that the sympathy he had
formerly felt for this clever and pleasing youth was
not the real cause of the temptation that led him
irresistibly to go to his house this very morning in
spite of the unusual hour. It was nearly noon. "I
hope I will find him." A thought that was not inspired
merely by a friendly feeling. The real cause was that
Raymond belonged to the most select class. To Alfred,
who had no idea of the air-tight partitions that
divide the different circles of the various nobilities,
this meant that his comrade certainly knew the Duchesse
d'Ivrea, or had heard her spoken of by people
who knew her. If any one could give him exact information
about her it was Contay, and Alfred Boyer
felt that he must have this information.</p>

<p>He hungered and thirsted for it, as much as if, instead
of being the simple posthumous secretary to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1627">[Pg 1627]</span>
marshal Prince of Augsbourg, the blood of this hero
coursed in his own veins, and he had a right to know
who bore this title of d'Ivrea, won at the cannon's
mouth on the battlefield. Besides, the will stipulated
that the Duchess should figure in the "Mémoires" as
the donor of the letters to Moreau, and was not his
own honor involved in these "Mémoires"? Had he
not devoted two precious years of his youth to them?
Was he not ready to devote a third, with this recompense
as his supreme ambition, that his name as a
poor scribbler should one day be linked forever with
that of the mighty warrior of the "Grande Armée"?
What if this woman, however, who bought a place in
the book with the gift of her fortune, had made herself
unworthy of the honor by some infamous action?
Was such a thing possible? No. The master of
Combes professed such a passionate reverence for his
grandfather!</p>

<p>That her name should be cited in the "Mémoires,"
that the Prince should conduct the funeral, that she
should be given a place in the tomb of the Frédets—never
would he admit it, even for a moment, and even
at the price of millions, that these three things could
be granted to a person unworthy.</p>

<p>But the Prince had not destroyed the will—then he
must have seen some possibility of conforming to it!
Yet his sadness and disgust, the tone of voice in
which he had spoken of <em>her</em>, as he put it, his first
movement, his subsequent silence—how were all these
contradictory indications to be reconciled? Alfred
hastened his steps toward the sole chance of learning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1628">[Pg 1628]</span>
the whole truth with a feverish impatience that
amounted almost to pain....</p>

<p>Raymond de Contay was at home getting ready to
go out to lunch. This was a relief to Boyer, who in
his embarrassment suddenly feared that it would look
as if he had come, thus early, in order to be asked to
stay for luncheon. But his classmate's welcome was
so cordial that he had no scruples about suggesting
that he should walk with him. As he ascended Raymond's
stairs he felt an almost painful apprehension
over the means he should employ in his quest. The
pretext was furnished to him by his friend, who, not
content with asking him about his work, wished to
know how he had got along at Combes. Boyer took
occasion to sketch in a few words the characters of
the Prince, his five daughters, and the maiden aunt.
With a lump in his throat at the thought of what he
might be about to learn he continued: "This is all I
have seen of the family. But there is another branch,
the younger, now represented by the Duchesse d'Ivrea"—he
looked for a sign of intelligence in his friend's
face. "Who is she?"—"The Duchesse d'Ivrea," replied
Raymond. "I do not know her."</p>

<p>"But she belongs to your world," said Alfred
naively; then giving way to the morbid curiosity that
had been goading him on ever since he had read the
will, he added: "You surely must know some people
who know her. I can not explain the matter to you,
but I have a strong interest in knowing why she is at
odds with her relatives. The matter concerns the entire
future of my work, perhaps. In fact, I ask you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1629">[Pg 1629]</span>
as a great service—understand me, a very great service
indeed—to try to find out about her for me."</p>

<p>He spoke in so serious a tone, his face expressed so
much anxiety, that Raymond was deeply impressed.
He thought that probably these "Mémoires of Frédet"
had started one of those disagreements between relatives
that sometimes prevent for many years the publication
of books of this sort.</p>

<p>"If you are so bent upon it," replied his comrade,
"I shall try to find out. I am lunching to-day with
one of my cousins, who belongs to all the clubs and
has Paris at his fingers' ends. If your Duchesse d'Ivrea
broke with her family for any reasons that have been
talked about, my cousin will know them. I will drop
you a line about it this evening, but I do not promise
you success. In any event, give me your address."</p>

<p>Although this chance of seeing a little more clearly
into the relations that existed between the celebrated
marshal's heirs was very dubious, it was a chance, and
for the time being the prospect calmed the agitation
into which the morning's episode had thrown Boyer.
He had a few errands to do relative to his work. He
attended to them all carefully, and about six o'clock
he found himself at the door of his lodgings in the
Rue de Bourgogne. He asked if his patron were in.
On the concièrge's reply that the Prince had not gone
out during the afternoon, Alfred was again seized
with the feverish curiosity of the morning.</p>

<p>Raymond had left no letter for him, from which
he concluded that the inquiry of the cousin had been
useless, and he ascended the stairs a prey to an uneasiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1630">[Pg 1630]</span>
that reached a climax when he found himself face
to face with the Prince. Evidently the unhappy man
was at the end of his mental resources. He paced to
and fro from one extremity to the other of the two
narrow chambers like a wild beast in a cage. The
luncheon that he had ordered had not been touched
and was still on the table, and at the first glance Alfred
could see that the envelope that contained the will had
not been moved from its place. It still rested under
the book on the marble mantel. It had been beyond
the Prince's strength even to touch it. Alas, the
temptation had begun to work in him. Alfred had
proof of it immediately in the words that were addressed
to him as soon as he appeared.</p>

<p>"I have had news from the Rue de Grenelle," said
the Prince. "It seems that she has had a severe attack
since we left her, and almost succumbed to it. The
doctor is not sure that she will live through the day.
You see, we did well to come when we did for the letters
to Moreau. Apropos of these letters, perhaps it
would be well to publish them separately. We will
talk it over. What I have been having a day-dream
about is a library made up of works concerning the
men of the First Empire who had relations with the
Prince, all his papers well classified, and all his memoirs,
and all of this installed in the d'Ivrea house
where we were this morning. I can see the house
now, stripped of the tawdry gewgaws that spoil it, and
restored to the exact condition in which it was in the
marshal's time. It would be very easy—we have the
inventories at Combes. I would like to make it a museum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1631">[Pg 1631]</span>
to the glory of the "Grande Armée," with rooms
consecrated to all the companions in arms whom he
loved—a Ney room, a Masséna room, a Davoust room,
a Macdonald room—what do you say to this project,
my dear Boyer, with you as perpetual curator at some
small emolument? Do not say no to it; you deserve
the place. Do you imagine that I do not know the
difference between purely mercenary work and that
which you have devoted to the "Mémoires"? But
your devotion shall not be lost. It is a pity that you
could not be in Paris with your time your own, all
your time, to devote to some great historical work.
You shall have it. It is also a pity—do you not think
so?—that so many objects of interest in the history of
the Empire should be hidden away at Combes and
that no one should know them? The portraits, for
instance; they must be brought here; they must be—and
it is the same with my daughters. I wish them
to be here; I wish them to be married—well and happily
married." For a long time he continued in this
vein without any response from the young man. The
Prince busied himself with the future employment of
the fortune that had suddenly fallen into his possession,
putting almost a kind of fever into his projects. He
reveled in anticipatory visions of the noble end to which
he would devote his wealth—always provided he accepted
it, for his ardor in justifying the acceptance in
advance clearly proved that he had not yet decided, as
did also the painful hesitation in his voice, in his gestures,
in the sound of his footsteps on the floor, and
still more in his obstinacy in not returning to the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1632">[Pg 1632]</span>
of his dying sister-in-law. Against what idea was he
struggling so violently? Against what apprehension
of remorse? Why did this flood of imaginative confidences—since
there was no question yet but of possibilities—roll
forth while the real confidence, that which
concerned the will, never appeared?</p>

<p>Alfred saw the whiteness of the envelope standing
out against the gray on the marble mantel, and as he
listened his heart became more oppressed with each
new phrase, for each was a fresh sign that the Prince
considered the acceptance of the conditions contained
in that envelope as an indelicacy, worse than that, as
a crime. A crime? Against whom? Against whom,
if not against this ancestor? What image obsessed
him, passing and repassing in all these words? that of
the marshal. It was as if by making promises to that
great figure he wished to disarm the anger of its shade,
to expiate in advance an outrage on its memory that
he was about to commit, that he had already committed
in not at once spurning a certain offer.</p>

<p>How long might this strange monologue have continued,
in which the grandson of the illustrious soldier
concealed the fever of a terrible indecision by
thinking aloud before a witness whose cognizance of
the facts he did not suspect? Would Alfred Boyer
have given way to the passionate longing he felt to
interrupt this half confession with his own complete
confession by crying out to the Prince: "I have read
the will!" Would he, on the other hand, have continued
to listen to this discourse, seeking to solve an
enigma of which the answer had not yet been given?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1633">[Pg 1633]</span></p>

<p>An incident he had not hoped for suddenly extricated
him from his uncertainty, all at once giving
frightful distinctness to what had until then been only
a vague guess. The servant came to tell him that
Monsieur de Contay was waiting to see him.</p>

<p>"I got some information, as I thought I would, from
my cousin," said Raymond after the other had flown
downstairs four steps at a time in his haste to know.
"I was not able to bring it to you before, and I have
only a minute." He pointed to the carriage which
was waiting for him in the street. "Here it is. The
present Duchesse d'Ivrea has never been received,
either by the family or by any one else. She was a
fast woman, who had formerly been on the stage. She
was then called Leona d'Asti. After living a very gay
life, she married an old swindler on his deathbed, a
confessed thief named Audry, who left her a very
large fortune. Once a widow, she married d'Ivrea,
a poor devil, who, it seems, had eaten and drunk up
everything he had—a most shameful union for one
of his name. Now you know as much as I do."...</p>

<p>Next morning, when the Prince of Augsbourg
awoke from a sleep broken by all the nightmares by
which intense moral anguish pursues us even in our
rest, his first glance was toward the ill-fated envelope
that his fingers had not touched since he had placed
it under the book. Had he been dreaming? Had all
the internal tempest of which he had been the victim
been a hallucination, a stroke of madness? The envelope
was not there. He jumped out of bed and went
to the mantel; he lifted up the book. Nothing! Immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1634">[Pg 1634]</span>
the whole series of events came back to him.
No; he had not been mad. The scenes of the preceding
day arose in his mind with a certainty that left no
room for doubt; his visit to his sister-in-law, his return
to his lodgings, Alfred Boyer handing to him the
envelope and what had followed, his afternoon spent
in struggling against temptation, Alfred's return, then
his going out again, the note that the young man had
afterward sent him and in which he said that he would
dine out with a friend. The Prince had spent the
evening alone, eating his heart out over the evil action
that had such a horrible attraction for him. He had
gone to bed early, without having been able to eat
anything, in order to try to forget this ill-fated will,
to forget himself. He had heard his neighbor come
in about midnight—then all was a blank. He had fallen
asleep, and now this mystery, this envelope missing.
But how? Stolen—by whom?</p>

<p>He began to dress, a prey to the superstitious fear
that sometimes lays hold of the most energetic men in
face of an absolutely incomprehensible fact, and little
by little his ideas began to coordinate in his mind. Of
the two doors of his chamber, one, that which opened
upon the stairs, was fastened with a bolt; he had neglected
to turn the key on that which led to Alfred
Boyer's room. The thief, then, must have come in
by that door during his sleep. But he had remained
awake until the young man had come in. Suddenly
the Prince recalled the latter's face at the time of the
discovery of the will; how he had flushed and avoided
his eyes. He remembered also the expression on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1635">[Pg 1635]</span>
transparent face while, late in the afternoon, he had
been developing those projects, all of which presupposed
a change in the condition of his fortune. As in
a flash of lightning the whole thing was clear to
him. He sank half dressed upon a chair. He sat
there motionless, a prey to a tumult of so many contradictory
and violent emotions that his whole body
trembled; disillusionment as to this fortune, suddenly
snatched away, if the young man had actually destroyed
the will; shame at having been seen by him,
tempted and giving way to the temptation, anger at
Alfred's audacity in having interfered, and by what
right? Through his veneration for the marshal's memory,
remorse that this veneration had been stronger in
an outsider than in himself, and, in spite of all, a sort of
sorrowful joy at this deliverance, if the will no longer
really existed, with its shameful conditions, which
were, indeed, less shameful than the origin of ignoble
money. Again the d'Ivrea house rose before his
mind's eye; he saw the great door hung with black
draperies, with his coat-of-arms, the bier upon which
that miserable creature, that public woman enriched
by a swindler, who had dishonored his brother, should
lie, himself behind her conducting this sinister mourning;
and the tomb, the tomb! Wildly, as the prisoner
who escapes from his cell through broken bars stained
with his blood, but sustained, intoxicated by the freedom
of liberty, he burst into the room where Alfred
sat at his table. His bed had not been disturbed. He
had not slept, and his pale face, his burning eyes, betrayed
in what agony he had spent the sleepless hours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1636">[Pg 1636]</span>
Ever since he had glided into the Prince's bedroom to
take the will and burn it he had been awaiting the
terrible moment when his patron should awake, determined
this time not to make any denial and to suffer
the consequences of his act, whatever they might be.</p>

<p>"Boyer," said the Prince, "when you gave me that
envelope yesterday, had you read the paper that it
contained?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the young man.</p>

<p>"Did you know who the person was that wrote that
paper?"</p>

<p>"I have learned since."</p>

<p>"And it was you who destroyed the will?"</p>

<p>"It was I."</p>

<p>"It was you!" cried the Prince; "you!" Then,
bursting into sobs: "Let me embrace you and thank you
in his name!" and he pointed with his hand to the thin
sheets on the table in which was to be recognized the
proud, delicate writing of "Catinat of the Grande
Armée," of "the Black Lion," as the old soldiers of
the First Empire had called him to distinguish him
from his brother in arms, Ney, "the Red Lion." Tears
streamed down his face, so like that of his glorious
ancestor, while he pressed Alfred to his breast, and
both of them, the old man and the young, felt that
exquisite emotion that floods our souls with melancholy
and an almost supernatural serenity when we
have paid a sacred debt to the dead.</p>

Publishing Company.</p>



<p>Madame de Précy said to her husband:
"You wish to know what is the matter?
Oh! I will tell you, if for a few moments
you will condescend to lend me your attention."</p>

<p>In an icy tone he answered: "I will not lend, I will
give it to you."</p>

<p>"Well, then, the matter is"—and a trembling voice
betrayed her excitement—"that life with you has become
unbearable and that I have resolved no longer
to try to endure it. You are, I admit, an honorable
man, and have, I believe, been a faithful husband. I,
on my side, have never forgotten my marriage vows.
Here we stand on the same ground. The trouble is
that we are uncongenial. Everything I do annoys you,
and to me all your ways are insufferable. What I
say always vexes you, and your laugh drives me crazy.
Even when silent, we provoke each other. About the
merest trifles we have frightful scenes—about a hat,
a dress, whether it will be best to carry a cane or an
umbrella, or whether the meat is overdone or not—in
short, everything—and everything makes us quarrel!
Then, at home, either you talk so much that I can not
put in a word or else you do not open your lips, and
you look about as cheerful as a mortuary chapel. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1640">[Pg 1640]</span>must be happy when you are happy, sad when you are
sad. Your temper is changeable, odd, quick; you do
not allow the slightest contradiction; if I begin to speak
of something which does not interest you, I am not
allowed to finish my sentence. For me to express an
opinion suffices to make you take an opposite view.
You insist that you understand music, and that I know
nothing about politics, while, in point of fact, the
contrary is the truth. You scold my maid until she
cries, and your disgusting valet drinks all the wine in
my cellar. You forbid me to smoke, and insist that my
dresses shall not be cut too low. And when we quarrel,
even about some very ordinary matter, instead of its
being over in five minutes, it lasts for hours, and we
try to outdo each other in saying bitter things which
neither of us forgets. In short, everything about me
is disagreeable to you. I feel it, and I know it; you
hate the tone of my voice, the sound of my step, my
gestures, even my clothes; do not deny it, at this very
moment I can read in your face that you would like
to pitch me out of the window.</p>

<p>"Therefore?" said Monsieur de Précy.</p>

<p>"Therefore I conclude that it is wiser for us not
to prolong our experience of married life. Its having
proved a failure is neither your fault nor mine, or
rather it is the fault of both; at any rate it is a fact.
We were not made to live together; until we cease to
do so, neither of us will be happy. After all, there
is nothing to prevent us from amicably parting.
Fortunately there is no child to quarrel about, we
have each an ample fortune, so I really can not see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1641">[Pg 1641]</span>
why we should any longer remain on the same perch,
pulling out each other's feathers. As for me, I have
had enough of it, and you have had too much. I am
quite sure you will be happy; sometimes in the morning,
while you are shaving, you will think of me; and
for my part I shall always remember you as a perfectly
honorable, thoroughly disagreeable man. But
for that I bear you no ill-will, because it is in your
blood, all the Précys are so, and your own father and
mother, as you have often told me, could never contrive,
for more than ten days at a time, to remain together.
However, I will waste no more breath in
talking about the matter, but will now, Monsieur, retire
to my own rooms, where until to-morrow I shall
pass my time in thinking over the most practical way
in which to arrange our separation."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Précy had in silence received this avalanche
of reproaches, but his lips twitched, once or
twice he sighed, deeply sighed, and toward the middle
of the discourse he had begun to pace the floor. When
his wife ceased speaking he stopped before her, and,
looking at her with an expression which he strove to
render as dignified as possible, said in a sad, somewhat
victimized, tone of voice: "Have you finished?"—"I
have finished, and it is finished."—"So be it, my
dear; the book is closed, and I, like you, think it
best not again to open it. As you wish it, we will to-morrow
separate and each try solitude."—"Oh, I
permit you to enliven it!"—"Thanks, and I forbid
you to do so."—"Gracious! I do not dream of
such a thing. When I leave you, it is to become my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1642">[Pg 1642]</span>
own mistress, not to change masters. You can be quite
easy; to marry again would be a folly I shall never
commit. Have you anything more to say?"—"No,
except that if we take this step without knowing to
what it may lead...."—"Oh! I know. First to
peace, then to old age, finally to Père Lachaise."—"Do
not joke, but please allow me to finish. We will do as
we wish, but it is not necessary that the world should
be at once enlightened as to our disagreements. That
is my opinion, and I think you will agree with me."—"I
do not know, because, of course, people can not
long remain ignorant...."—"Yes, but for a time.
Later the same objections will not exist. In short, this
is what I ask: before taking any measures to obtain a
divorce, let us by all means separate, but under special
conditions which will save appearances, and excite no
suspicions in the minds of our friends."—"What, then,
is your idea?"—"As you wish to leave to-morrow, do
so; but instead of taking refuge with some friend
in the country or abroad, as is probably your intention,
go to Meneaux, my château in Brittany, and
as long as you can endure it—two months, if you
have the courage—remain there. Madame Bénard,
my parents' old housekeeper, who brought me up, is
in charge. She will receive you, and in every way
look after your comfort. You can tell her that I will
soon join you."—"That, I imagine, will not be the
truth."—"No, but you had better say so. The house is
well furnished, pretty, and not more than four miles
from Guérande. Under the pretext that Brittany is too
far away from Paris, you have always avoided setting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1643">[Pg 1643]</span>
foot upon this family estate where my childhood was
passed. This, before we each go our own way in life,
is a good opportunity to look at it. If you let this
chance escape, you will never have another. Now can
I count upon you? Do you consent?"—"You have
made your request with civility, and I consent. I will
go to Meneaux, and will remain there for two months.
You may send a telegram to Madame Bénard."</p>

<p>Then a few words more were exchanged with a
coldness too intense to be quite genuine.—"Thanks—good
night—good-by!—yes, good-by!"—Their voices
did not tremble, oh no; but their hearts, their poor
hearts, ached! Each one privately thought: "What?
Can it be true we are to part—and forever? That
is what we shall see, my wife! I'm not quite sure
about that, my husband!"</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, Madame de Précy the next day
departed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On a clear, fresh May morning the young woman
arrived at Meneaux. It is at the seaside, a delightful
moment when spring, like a tiny child on its uncertain
legs, hesitatingly treads there. The sparse, backward
vegetation is more rugged than elsewhere; the blue of
the sky has a deeper tint, and in the salt air there is
something bracing and healthful which brings red to
the cheek and peace to the soul.</p>

<p>For Madame de Précy's occupation, Madame Bénard
had prepared, on the second floor, a large bedchamber,
wainscoted in oak and hung with old sulphur-colored
damask, which on one side overlooked a wide expanse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1644">[Pg 1644]</span>
of flat country, broken only here and there by a rock
or a thin cluster of reeds; and on the other a pine wood
ceaselessly murmuring in the breeze.</p>

<p>After she had emptied her trunks and made herself
at home in her room, Madame de Précy found plenty
of time for reflection. Nature offers to those who at
a moral crisis fly to her, many consolations. By a sort
of reflex action, she deadens pain, soothes and cheers.
Her immutability, her apparent egotism, are good advisers.
Before her who does not pass away one learns
to see that everything else will do so, our little happinesses
as well as our great sorrows; and the order
which in everything she observes incites us to order also
our hearts and minds. Madame de Précy began to
think, and more seriously than for many and many a
long day before. She reviewed her entire past life, beginning
with the first white pages of cradle, dolls, first
communion, long skirts and balls, next turning to the
chapter of marriage. Her life had not been a romance,
scarcely even a story, but very ordinary, without great
joys, great catastrophes, or anything striking. Every
night she had gone to bed with the secret hope that
the next day something might happen. During the
nine years of her married life, the sun had risen many
times, but never had anything happened. Little by
little she and her husband had become embittered, and
perhaps he also, without being willing to admit it, had
suffered from that monotony to some beings so irritating—monotony
of things, hours, events, crimes,
heroisms, vices, seasons, rain, sun, admirations, and
anticipations. Her husband was not a man to be despised:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1645">[Pg 1645]</span>
cultivated, distinguished, honorable, sometimes
(only sometimes) tender-hearted—in fact, admirable—yet
impossible to live with. So, while deploring her
fate, in the bloom of youth finding herself thus alone
and in a false position, she did not, however, regret
the impulse to which she had yielded. She would not
know happiness, but she could have peace. One can
not expect everything at once. Without feeling that
her dignity was compromised, she gladly accepted the
society of Madame Bénard, the old housekeeper in
charge of the château, and yet, as a rule, she was
haughty. But Madame Bénard had brought up Monsieur
de Précy, and then the country equalizes; its
solitude brings together human beings, raising a little
those who are below, and lowering a little those who
are above, so that Madame de Précy and the good old
lady—for a lady she really was—soon became friends.</p>

<p>On the day Madame Bénard took Madame de
Précy through the château, she went first to a large
room on the third story, and, as she pushed open the
door, said: "I want to begin by showing you everything
connected with Monsieur's childhood. This is
the room where Monsieur played and amused himself
when he was a little boy." Then she opened closets
where lay balls, drums, trumpets, boxes of tin soldiers,
games of patience, checkers, and dominoes, saying as
one after another she fingered them: "These were
Monsieur's playthings when he was a little boy." And
suddenly she pulled from a heap a doll with a broken
nose. "See, Madame! he even had a doll, that boy; he
called her Pochette, and when he kissed her he used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1646">[Pg 1646]</span>
say: 'She shall be my wife!' Was it not ludicrous?
Well, he would not say that now. He has something
better." Madame de Précy did not reply. The housekeeper
questioned: "It must agitate you to see all
these things?"—"Yes, Madame Bénard."</p>

<p>Then the old lady took her to see the room where
Monsieur used to sleep; sometimes forgetting herself,
instead of Monsieur, she said Louis; and Madame de
Précy was strangely moved at hearing pronounced by
another that name she had so often called, but might
never say again. The room where her husband used
to study was next exhibited, with its shelves still filled
by his old school-books and copy-books. One of the
latter was seized by Madame Bénard, who, tendering it
to Madame de Précy, cried: "See how well Monsieur
wrote when he was a little boy." And traced in large,
uncertain letters she read: "Let us love one another."
Then she exclaimed: "I should like to go out into
the air; I do not feel quite well."</p>

<p>They went out of doors, and for some moments
silently walked about. When a large pond, on which
floated two beautiful white swans, was presently approached,
Madame Bénard announced: "Here is the
pond where Monsieur kept his boat when he was a little
boy. One evening he came near drowning himself. I
shall never forget that."</p>

<p>When, a few steps farther on, they reached an old
straight-backed, moss-grown wooden bench, on either
side of which stood a tall earthenware vase, she cried:
"This is the bench where Monsieur used to sit and
read when he was a little boy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1647">[Pg 1647]</span></p>

<p>Next they entered the vegetable garden, and Madame
Bénard, walking at once toward a little plot,
enclosed by a hedge of box, said again: "This was
Monsieur's garden when he was a little boy."</p>

<p>As they afterward crossed the servants' court, a
glimpse of the farm horses in their stalls, afforded by
widely opened stable doors, caused Madame Bénard
to exclaim: "Oh, Boniface used to be kept there!"</p>

<p>"What was Boniface?" asked Madame de Précy.</p>

<p>"Boniface was Monsieur's pony when he was a little
boy."</p>

<p>So clearly had Madame Bénard brought before
Madame de Précy a little Louis who studied, read,
wrote, laughed, and played that she almost saw him
now, in short trousers with sunburnt legs and bare
head, running across the garden.</p>

<p>When later in the day they were both seated in the
dining-room near a large window overlooking the sea,
Madame Bénard began in a simple way to relate the
story of Monsieur when he was a little boy. It was
not very cheerful.</p>

<p>"I must tell you, Madame," said the old woman,
"that Monsieur's parents were very peculiar. You
never saw them, but I knew them well.</p>

<p>"Just imagine, they actually disliked each other, and
without any good reason. That they were not 'congenial'
was the only excuse they could give for living
almost always apart; but think how wicked that was!
If the father was in Paris the mother traveled, and
when she returned he went away. They both loved
Monsieur Louis, but rather than share his society preferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1648">[Pg 1648]</span>
entirely to deprive themselves of it. So he was
sent here to me, and I had to be to him both father
and mother. That is the way I happened to bring
him up, and I did my best. His parents both died
quite young, and he, poor child, wept as bitterly as if
he had known them. I can forgive him, but I'm quite
sure that when I die he will not grieve as much.</p>

<p>"I tell you all this, Madame, because perhaps he has
never done so, and also that you may be able to make
allowance for him if sometimes he appears nervous,
quick-tempered, or moody. It is not his fault; it is
the fault of old times when he was a little boy. Had it
not been for his deserted, lonely childhood, he would
have grown up quite a different man."</p>

<p>All this Madame Bénard said and much besides,
telling many anecdotes, and giving a mass of details,
so that the conversation lasted until evening. Neither
of the two women thought of ringing for a lamp, and
darkness enveloped them. Therefore, Madame Bénard
did not observe that Madame de Précy was furtively
drying her eyes. When she rose it was to say:</p>

<p>"All you have related about my husband has interested
me very much, dear Madame Bénard," and she
warmly pressed the good old woman's hands. This
did not astonish Madame Bénard, nor was she surprised
when the young woman handed her a telegram
for Paris to be sent to the office at Guérande. What
did the telegram contain? What is sure is that it was
sent that night, and that the next day Monsieur de
Précy arrived.</p>

comedies that have been acted at nearly all of
the best Paris theatres, the first called "L'Affaire
Champignon," in collaboration with Pierre
Veber, 1899, and the latest "Menton Bleus."
Courteline is a sincere, earnest genius, but he
prefers to masquerade as an amuser—he has
been summed up as the nearest approach the
French have to a Mark Twain. He assumes
the quick, snappy, humorous, jaunty business
style of the reporter as a rule, but in his one-act
verse, called "Conversion d'Alceste," acted
at the Comédie Française in 1905, he appears
as a misanthrope.</em></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A GENTLEMAN FINDS A WATCH</h2>
</div>

<p class="center p1 big1">BY GEORGES COURTELINE</p>


<p class="center p2b">Translated by V. Quiroga.<br> Copyright, 1907, by P. F. Collier &amp; Son.</p>


<p>From the top seats of L'Étoile tram-car
I perceived my friend Bréloc, who was just
crossing the Place Blanche in such a state of
excitement that I descended from the car on purpose
to question him.</p>

<p>"Hey! my God! what is the matter, Bréloc? What
is the meaning of this face of yours, more mournful
than a shop closed on account of a death in the
family?"</p>

<p>"Please don't mention it," he replied; "I just had
a narrow escape from being put in jail."</p>

<p>Which led me to think that he had committed some
dishonest action, and I began to ejaculate rather
loudly, when he, guessing the turn of my thoughts,
exclaimed: "You don't seem to understand! I was
very nearly being put in jail through an unlucky watch
that I picked up last night on the Boulevard Saint
Michel, and which I honestly deposited in the hands of
the commissaire [police inspector] of our ward. Pretty
tough, heigh? I feel almost ill from astonishment
and fright. But you can judge by yourself. Have
you five minutes to spare?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Why not?"</p>

<p>"Then listen, and I hope you may profit by my
experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1652">[Pg 1652]</span></p>
<p>"About nine <small>A.M.</small> I presented myself at the police
station in the Rue Duperré carrying said watch—a
beautiful timepiece, by the way, with gold case and
platina monogram—and I asked to be shown to the
commissaire. That gentleman had just finished drinking
his cup of chocolate, when he gave orders that I
should be admitted to his presence, and without deigning
to say good day or offer me a seat, he began:</p>

<p>"'What do you wish?'</p>

<p>"I had composed my features for the occasion, with
the smile of a man who accomplishes a meritorious
act for which he expects to be almost crowned with
glory. So I answered: "'Monsieur le Commissaire
of Police, I have the honor of depositing into your
hands a watch that I found last night, and—'</p>

<p>"Without letting me finish the sentence, the commissaire
sprang up, repeating the words:</p>

<p>"'A watch! A watch!'</p>

<p>"The gendarmes were playing a game of cards in
the next room.</p>

<p>"He hallooed to them:</p>

<p>"'Hey! you there! Close the street door! There
is more draft here than in a windmill!' And he remained
grumbling until his order had been executed.</p>

<p>"Then, resuming his seat, he proceeded:</p>

<p>"'Please give me that article.'</p>

<p>"I handed him the watch, which he began to turn
about, examining and turning the winder, opening
the case and the chain swivel.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he said gravely, 'it is indeed a watch, there
is no denying.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1653">[Pg 1653]</span></p>

<p>"Saying which, he deposited the watch in the
depths of a very large safe, closing its three locks.</p>

<p>"I looked with astonishment, and he resumed:</p>

<p>"'And where did you find this valuable article?'</p>

<p>"'Boulevard Saint Michel, at the corner of Rue
Monsieur-le-Prince.'</p>

<p>"On the ground?' asked the commissaire; 'on the
sidewalk?'</p>

<p>"I answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"'It is very extraordinary,' he then said with a
suspicious look at me; 'the sidewalk is not the usual
place to leave a watch.'</p>

<p>"I remarked smilingly:</p>

<p>"'If I may call your attention—'</p>

<p>"Dryly the commissaire said:</p>

<p>"'That will do! You may omit all remarks. I
know my business.'</p>

<p>"I stopped talking and smiling.</p>

<p>"He resumed: 'In the first place, who are you?'</p>

<p>"I gave my name.</p>

<p>"'Where do you live?'</p>

<p>"'I have already said that I live at the Place
Blanche, 26, second floor.'</p>

<p>"'What are your means of living?'</p>

<p>"I explained that I had an income of twelve thousand
francs.</p>

<p>"'At what time, as near as you can tell, did you
find the watch?'</p>

<p>"'Three o'clock <small>A.M.</small>'</p>

<p>"'Was not it later?' he remarked ironically.</p>

<p>"'I don't think it was,' I said candidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1654">[Pg 1654]</span></p>

<p>"'Well, I congratulate you,' he said ironically. 'It
seems to me that you are leading a somewhat singular
existence.'</p>

<p>"As I was taking exception on my right to live
according to my fancy:</p>

<p>"'Admitted!' said the commissaire. 'But I have a
right to know what the deuce you could be doing at
that hour on the Boulevard Saint Michel, corner of
Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, you who <em>say</em> that you are
living at the Place Blanche?'</p>

<p>"'What do you mean by that, I <em>say</em>?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, you say so.'</p>

<p>"'If I say so, it is a fact.'</p>

<p>"'That is what we must have proved. Meanwhile,
please do not divert from the conversation, and
answer courteously to all the questions that I feel
duty bound to put to you. I am asking what were
you doing at that unearthly hour in a neighborhood
that was not your own?'</p>

<p>"I explained (as it was true) that I was coming
from the house of a lady friend.</p>

<p>"'What does she do, your lady friend?'</p>

<p>"'She is a married woman.</p>

<p>"'Married. To whom?'</p>

<p>"'To a druggist.'</p>

<p>"'What is his name?'</p>

<p>"'That is none of your business,' I answered, impatiently.</p>

<p>"'Is it to me that you are talking like that?' hallooed
the commissaire.</p>

<p>"'Of course.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1655">[Pg 1655]</span></p>

<p>"The commissaire's face became purple.</p>

<p>"'But, my boy! you will have to alter your tune;
that strain of yours does not suit me. And—I fancy
that I recollect your features.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, bosh!'</p>

<p>"'Yes—I do have a recollection—'</p>

<p>"There was a moment of silence. Then:</p>

<p>"'Have you ever been committed for trial, Bréloc?'</p>

<p>"This exhausted my patience.</p>

<p>"'And you?' said I.</p>

<p>"The commissaire sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"'You are a blackguard!' he cried.</p>

<p>"'And you are an idiot!' I retorted.</p>

<p>"At that moment I thought my last hour had come.
The commissaire bounded toward me, flushed and
foaming with rage. Under his bushy eyebrows I
could see the glistening of his wild eyes.</p>

<p>"'What are you saying?' he stammered. 'What
are you saying?'</p>

<p>"I attempted to utter a word, but he did not give
me a chance.</p>

<p>"'And I say this: that I am going to send you to
jail; and it will not take a very long time! It is just
the hour for the patrol wagon! Who on earth sent
me up this dummy? Ah! you want to put on airs!
Ah! you want to jeer at me, and at the law that I
represent! Very well! you came to the wrong place!'</p>

<p>"He brought down his fist violently on the papers
lying on his table with each of his sentences, adding:</p>

<p>"'Do I know you? Do I know who you are? You
say that your name is Bréloc; I don't know anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1656">[Pg 1656]</span>
about it! You say that you live at the Place Blanche.
Where are the proofs of it? You say that you have
twelve thousand francs income. Am I bound to believe
you? Show me your twelve thousand francs!
Hein! you would have a hard job to show them to
me.'</p>

<p>"I was stunned.</p>

<p>"'All this is not very clear,' he concluded violently.
'I say, do you understand me, that it is not very clear,
and I don't know if you did not steal it, that watch!'</p>

<p>"'Steal it!'</p>

<p>"'Yes, steal it! Anyhow, I am going to find out.'</p>

<p>"The gendarmes, hearing the noise, had come into
the room. He called out to them:</p>

<p>"'Search this man!'</p>

<p>"In a second they undressed me completely, even
down to my socks.</p>

<p>"'Ah! you want to be smart!' the commissaire repeated
mockingly. 'Ah! you want to play smart!
Look under his arms,' he said to the gendarmes.
'Search him well!'"</p>

<p>At the recital of these indignities Bréloc's voice became
overexcited. But I was laughing, nodding my
head approvingly, because I could recognize in his recital
the two implacable enemies of honest folk—the
administration and the law.</p>

<p>"Let me find another watch!" roared my unfortunate
friend, with a closed fist as if threatening the
future.</p>

<h3>MY SUITORS</h3>

<p class="right p1" style="padding-right: 2em;"><em>November —, 18—.</em></p>

<p>Just as I was going up to my room, Monday
night, mama kissed me, and said in the severe tone
which she reserves for communications touching
my marriage: "Juliette, two gentlemen will dine with
us Thursday. Consider it settled. You know what
you must do." I considered it settled, certainly; but
mama was mistaken in one thing—I was in absolute
ignorance as to what I must do. What is there for
a young girl to do from Monday till Thursday, when
she is to be inspected by two suitors for her hand?
I can not change in face or form, and I really haven't
the time to learn a new language, one of those tongues
which possess, so mama says, such a powerful attraction
for marriageable men! Nor have I even the time
to order a new gown. I have decided, therefore, to
remain just as I am, and to present to those gentlemen
Thursday evening the Juliette of Monday, with
her pink and white complexion, her five feet four of
stature, and the two poor little living languages which
she murders atrociously.</p>

<p>Who are these gentlemen? I have a faint suspicion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1660">[Pg 1660]</span></p>
<p>Mama will not tell me their names, for she fears my
preliminary criticisms. Usually I sit upon her candidates
so thoroughly beforehand that she dares not
exhibit them. "They are charming men," she declares;
"charming, that expresses it. Much too good for a
madcap like you. One of them is no longer young; but
the other is not yet thirty." That mama of mine has
such an adorable way of putting things! She regards
my suitors collectively, offsetting the faults of the
one with the good qualities of the other. Would
she like to have me marry all of them at once, I
wonder?</p>

<p>Papa gave me more information. I do anything I
choose with papa by a walk to the Champs Elysées in
the morning, or a stroll on the boulevards about five
o'clock. I walk along with my hands clasped around
his right arm, clinging to him, my large gray eyes
raised to his white beard as if in adoration. People
nudge each other as we pass, and how papa straightens
up, and how happy he is! In these moments, if I were
not a good girl, I could have my allowance doubled,
or all the diamonds in the shop windows. It was on
returning from just such a stroll that I questioned my
dear old papa about the two musketeers that are to
open fire next Thursday. Immediately he grew grave
and answered:</p>

<p>"They are two charming men—charming, that expresses
it. Much too good for a—"</p>

<p>"Madcap like me. Agreed. Why do you let mama
put things into your head, you, who have such sound
judgment? It is shameful!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1661">[Pg 1661]</span></p>

<p>Now, nothing irritates papa so much as the discovery
of mama's exaggerated influence over him.</p>

<p>"Put things into my head! Put things into my
head, indeed! I will not permit you to say that your
mother puts things into my head. I can judge men
at a glance. The duke (papa was a prefect under the
Empire) used always to say: 'Givernay—he is my
hand and eye.' Do you know that, little one?" I
should think I know the saying of the duke. At the
age of three I had already heard it told so often in
the family that I never said "papa" without immediately
adding "hand," "eye."</p>

<p>"Why, papa dear, you know very well that I am
of the duke's opinion, and that is the reason I want
you to guide me a little with your experience. I am
not a judge of men myself, and suppose both these
gentlemen should please me next Thursday?"</p>

<p>Evidently this contingency had not been thought of.
And, nevertheless, suppose I should be smitten with
both of them, with the one who is no longer young,
and with him who is not yet thirty? Papa's eye, celebrated
by Morny, grew large and round.</p>

<p>He reflected.</p>

<p>How amused I was!</p>

<p>"These two gentlemen," said he finally, "are certainly
both capable of pleasing. However, I know
one of them better, and therefore am disposed to favor
him. He is a companion of the Imperial, Monsieur de
Nivert, forty-three, cultured and high-spirited."</p>

<p>"What does he do?"</p>

<p>Papa wrinkled his brow and racked his brain in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1662">[Pg 1662]</span>
endeavor to think what Monsieur de Nivert could possibly
do; after which he concluded, pitiably enough:</p>

<p>"I believe he doesn't do anything!"</p>

<p>And then he immediately resorted to mama's mode
of defense; he considered the two collectively.</p>

<p>"But, on the other hand," said he, "the other gentleman
is a young man with a brilliant future. He is
Judge of the Exchequer, and not yet thirty. Just
think of it! Gaston Salandier will be director-general
of a great administration some day, or a minister, perhaps.
And then he is very good looking."</p>

<p>Poor Monsieur de Nivert! It seems after all that
his most brilliant qualities are possessed by Monsieur
Salandier! This freak of Dame Fortune begins to
make me sympathetic.</p>

<p>"But," said I, after a few moments' reflection, "it
seems to me that mama was hesitating among four
possible matches for me, and not between two."</p>

<p>Papa smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes; but after thoroughly considering the candidates,
we have decided that two only are worthy of
the prettiest girl in Paris. For," he added, kissing
me, "you are the prettiest girl in Paris."</p>

<p>Poor papa, I should like a husband like him. And
just think how desperate mama makes him!</p>

<p>Let us sum up the situation: Fate decrees that I
shall become the wife of a serious young man, or of
a middle-aged fashionable man of the world. Let me
think a moment. No; I have never seen even the picture
of the brilliant Judge of the Exchequer, who may,
perhaps, be minister. But I think I noticed Baron de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1663">[Pg 1663]</span>
Nivert at a club entertainment. It seems to me that
he has not much hair, but, by way of compensation,
as mama would say, he has a small stomach—oh, quite
small. On the whole, he is not distasteful to me, for
the baron, if I remember rightly, is very elegant and
stylish in his dress.</p>

<p>Well, the die is cast! Idle nobleman or plebeian
with a future, it is one of you two, gentlemen, who
will wed—in January—Mademoiselle Juliette Givernay.</p>


<h3>THE PRESENTATION</h3>

<p>It is over. The presentation took place last night,
and I must jot down the story of that memorable evening
for the amusement of my old age.</p>

<p>Well, last night, at five minutes to eight, when my
maid had assured me that all our guests had arrived,
I made my appearance in the drawing-room. Entering
a room is my forte. I don't think I have often
failed in it. I walk straight ahead, gazing steadily
before me over the eyes of those present; I do not
see, nor do I wish to see any of those who are looking
at me. I choose, on the contrary, as a point of
direction, some old lady settled comfortably in an armchair,
or some inoffensive old friend of papa's, or simply
mama. Invariably all conversation ceases at once,
and all eyes are centred on me. What wonderful tact
I possess, and isn't it a pity to be compelled to exercise
it in such a limited sphere?</p>

<p>Besides my parents, my suitors, and myself, the
diners yesterday were Count and Countess d'Aube,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1664">[Pg 1664]</span>
nobility of the Empire, whose combined ages would
make a century and a half—insufferable bores, but fine
people withal; Madame Salandier, the mother of the
young Judge of the Exchequer, bourgeoise, with a
protruding forehead, round eyes, and a ridiculous toilet,
who showed much embarrassment at finding herself
in our society.</p>

<p>At table Monsieur de Nivert sat on mama's right
and Monsieur Salandier on her left. I found myself
seated between Madame Salandier and Monsieur de
Nivert. Madame Salandier immediately began talking
to me in quite a patronizing tone that quickly irritated
me. She extolled the serious character of her
son, whom she proudly called "my own." "My own"
retires every night at ten. She also offered me a
few cursory glimpses of the qualities she expected her
future daughter-in-law to possess—her deportment,
economy, and domestic habits—"with occasionally a
reception or an evening at the theatre, of course; that
is necessary in the position which 'my own' occupies."</p>

<p>In the mean time "my own," quite at his ease and
stroking from time to time his pointed beard (he is
really very handsome), was holding forth on the reduction
of the public debt.</p>

<p>Papa, mama, Monsieur d'Aube, Mademoiselle Espalier
and even old Madame d'Aube, who is as deaf as
a post, listened with open mouths, and Madame Salandier
whispered in my ear:</p>

<p>"Listen to him. Not a minister is there that knows
as much about it as he does—"</p>

<p>I looked at Monsieur de Nivert. He met my glance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1665">[Pg 1665]</span>
with one of discreet irony, and immediately we felt
like comrades, two exiles from the same country who
had fallen among barbarians.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Nivert is not handsome, but it is astonishing
what an immense advantage he has gained over
his rival by simply not saying a word about the public
debt. In pouring me a glass of wine he paid me a
neat compliment upon my toilet, saying that there was
something truly elegant and uncommon about it. And
then he began to talk of dress in a low tone, while "my
own" continued his harangue for the benefit of papa
and mama, who do not know how to add up the household
accounts, and of Monsieur d'Aube, who is an old
imbecile, and of Madame d'Aube, who is deaf. The
handsome judge, however, is not stupid if he is
pedantic. In a few moments he saw that he was
boring us.</p>

<p>"This conversation," said he, "must be quite tiresome
to Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," I replied artlessly; "I was not listening."</p>

<p>And I had the joy of seeing a look of dismay spread
over the countenances of my parents and the good
Espalier, while Madame Salandier glared at me like
a bonze who has just seen a street arab of Paris make
a face at his Buddha.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Nivert smiled.</p>

<p>A little piqued, I think, "my own" replied:</p>

<p>"Indeed, such a conversation is beyond the depths
of the young girls of our continent. In America they
willingly take part in such discussions. Is there not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1666">[Pg 1666]</span>
some State in the North where women have the right
to vote?"</p>

<p>"Do you hear, Juliette?" said mama.</p>

<p>Did I hear? I think I did! He wearied me, this
economist bent on matrimony, and I let him see it very
plainly. I took up the accusation of frivolity implied
in his sentence, but I took it up as a banner. Proudly
I declared my right—the right of a pretty woman to be
ignorant, frivolous, and whimsical. I argued the advantages
of frivolity over seriousness, and of spirit
and dash over dignity.</p>

<p>Oh, papa's expression and that of the two relics of
the Empire and the mother of "my own"!</p>

<p>"My own" seemed perfectly amazed at discovering
a young girl capable of giving him a retort that took
the wind out of his sails.</p>

<p>Nivert alone encouraged me with smiles and whispered
bravos.</p>

<p>The dinner ended in confusion.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room, in order to serve the coffee, I
became a very proper young lady again; but the company
had not regained its wonted composure. Madame
Salandier could find nothing better to say than
to ask:</p>

<p>"Isn't Mademoiselle Juliette going to play something
for us?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said mama.</p>

<p>"Ah," thought I, "you wish some music; well, then,
you shall have it. Wait a moment."</p>

<p>I seated myself at the piano and played—and I
played without stopping. I played everything that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1667">[Pg 1667]</span>
could remember, for striking upon the little black and
white keys soothed my nerves a little. Ah, you want
some music! Well, listen. Take some Massenet, a
little Mozart, some Serpette, some Wagner, and some
Beethoven, some Lecocq, and some Berlioz, some
Tchaikovsky, and some Nimporteki, one after another,
haphazard, pell-mell; one hour and three-quarters at
the piano without stopping. After which I turned
round and looked at my auditors. They resembled a
plantation after a hail-storm—they were simply annihilated.
They took immediate advantage of the lull
in the storm and fled. I was still caressing the keys
with my right hand, and they trembled lest I should
begin again. In a few minutes the drawing-room was
empty.</p>

<p>Mama came toward me:</p>

<p>"Will you tell me now, Mademoiselle—"</p>

<p>But I stopped her short.</p>

<p>"Listen, mother. You know that I am usually very
amiable and seldom nervous, but this evening I am
very nervous. Don't worry me, please. We will talk
to-morrow as much as you like."</p>

<p>And I ran lightly up to my room.</p>

<p>This morning, on coming down to breakfast, I expected
to find my parents with long faces, but oh, what
a surprise! they smiled upon me, they kissed me, and
were as sweet as could be.</p>

<p>The key to this mystery? It is this: Papa rejoined
the baron at the club last night about midnight, and
Monsieur de Nivert said to him:</p>

<p>"My dear Givernay, your daughter is adorable!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1668">[Pg 1668]</span>
You will, I hope, permit me to call upon the ladies
again as soon as possible."</p>

<p>But what is even more surprising is, that an hour
before breakfast a letter came from Madame Salandier,
in which that former chestnut vender declared
that "her son had been deeply impressed by the wit
and grace of Mademoiselle Juliette," etc., and finally
asked if my mother could receive her Monday to have
a serious talk with her.</p>

<p>My friend Pepita was quite right when she said:</p>

<p>"Little Juliette, there are two classes of men that
you must treat insolently in order to make them
respect you—servants and suitors."</p>

<p><em>Henri de Régnier, one of the most distinguished
living poets of France, was born at
Honfleur in 1864. He has published a number
of novels, such as "La Double Maîtresse," in
1901, aimed at reconstructing past eras of society,
and a volume of tales distinguished for
their originality. His first masters were Leconte
de Lisle and De Heredia, but in the
beauty of his harmony and tenderness he is
original. He is a symbolist, chief of that
younger generation of French writers who
have set out to enlarge the resources of their
national poetry. Edmund Gosse says that
"of the number of experiment makers ... he
comes nearest to presenting a definitely evolved
talent ... a genuine artist of pure and strenuous
vision."</em></p>

<p>As I walked through the streets of the city I kept
thinking of one of the stories which had been
related to me by Monsieur d'Amercœur.
Without having named the place where the circumstances
occurred he described it minutely, so that I
seemed to recognize everything. The old city, noble
and monastic, crumbling in its dismantled ramparts
beside the yellowish river, with, beyond, the mountains
piled against the horizon; the narrow streets,
half shade, half sunshine, the old walled-in houses,
the churches and numerous convents, each with its
chime of bells—all was familiar.</p>

<p>I seemed to find it again exactly as he described it,
this city, an old pile of stones, sombre or luminous,
wrapped in warmth and solitude, and the dusty ossification,
retaining for such of its monuments as were
yet standing the skeleton of past grandeur. In the
centre the houses were crowded in a compact mass,
still vast, outside of which the buildings were scattered,
while over all a sleep or torpor seemed to hover,
broken suddenly at times by a tolling or a merry
clang of bells.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1672">[Pg 1672]</span></p>
<p>The streets, paved with flat stones or hardened with
gravel, cut across each other oddly to open into squares
where the markets were held. The flocks of the
countryside gathered there to go away dispersed,
according to their sale. The auction and the church
service were, turn about, the sole occupations of the
inhabitants. The place remained rustic and devout.
The quick trot of the sheep pattered over the pavements,
which echoed with the sandals of the monks.
Pastor and flock jostled each other. The odor of the
shearing mingled with the smell of woolen cloth.
The air was redolent of incense and tallow. Shorn
and tonsured. Shepherds and priests.</p>

<p>I arrived at the angle of two streets. A fountain
was flowing into a time-worn basin. I remembered
the fountain; Monsieur d'Amercœur had praised the
freshness of its water. The street to the right ought
to lead to the Close of the Black Friars. I followed
its tortuosity, which wound into the very heart of the
city. A few poor shops displayed their wares. Chaplets
hung beside horsewhips. The street suddenly
grew wider. The high frontage of an old mansion
appeared. I had seen several others of the sort here
and there, but this one was noticeable by some peculiarities.
It was built on a battered stone masonry.
The windows, high above the soil, were grated. In
former times they must have utilized those foundations
on which arose the present edifice of severe architectural
design. At the corner of the structure the
street turned abruptly and descended by steps, gradually
encircling the back of the building, which proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1673">[Pg 1673]</span>
to be an ancient castle, a stronghold of which the
blocks of stone were laid into the living rock.</p>

<p>I recognized the Mansion d'Heurteleure. The
street ended; before me I saw an avenue of poplars.
Old stone sarcophagi, now empty, stood in rows amid
the long grass where a pathway had been worn. To
the right stretched a wall with a low door at the side.
I started as I perceived it. It opened into the herb
garden of the monks, the portal of whose convent
could be seen at the end of the walk. I paused and
approached the little mural door. It was massive and
iron-bound. The keyhole was shaped like a heart.</p>

<p>Continuing, I reached the convent porch and rang.
The porter admitted me. Immense corridors led to
vast halls. We ascended stairs, my guide gathering
up the skirts of his frock as we mounted. We met no
one. From the chapel, which I did not enter, came a
droning psalmody of psalms. I was shown through
several cloisters, one of them charming, square, full
of flowers, and habited by doves, which grouped on
the cornices like a natural, graceful bas-relief. From
a church spire visible in the distance the horologe was
ringing the hour. A great yellow sunflower was
looking into the deep water of a well and reflecting
there its golden disk, like a monstrance.</p>

<p>Nothing had altered since Monsieur d'Amercœur
visited the city. The same aspect proved the duration
of the same habits. The cracking of horsewhips still
mingled with the tinkling of rosaries; the convent bells
clanged their chimes together as of yore, when Monsieur
d'Amercœur in frock and cowl, his bare feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1674">[Pg 1674]</span>
sandaled, his staff in hand, came knocking at the door.
He asked to see the prior, which office was at that
time held by Dom Ricard, whose tomb I was shown
among the anonymous sepultures surrounding it. The
prior had preserved powerful links with the world
from which he had retired. Keeping one hand open
there for alms and lending it, at need, in exchange for
delicate enterprises, which might be aided by his prudence
and wisdom. Monsieur d'Amercœur explained
to him his costume, the motives for his coming, and
the details of his mission.</p>

<p>After twenty years of high service in the army, a
gentleman of the country, Monsieur d'Heurteleure returned
to settle. He married shortly after Mademoiselle
Callestie, a poor girl of good family and great
beauty. The wedded pair lived at the d'Heurteleure
mansion. The nobles of the city frequented the house,
the most assiduous in his visits being Monsieur d'Aiglieul.
He had served under and was related to Monsieur
d'Heurteleure, who was very fond of him. Life
at the mansion was very simple, no pomp, very few
domestics; the dignity of rank was upheld by the vast
proportion of the apartments, the width of the stairways,
and the general aspect of antiquity.</p>

<p>Whether they grew weary of the dull existence
in this old town after the excitements of a military
life, were seized suddenly by a spirit of adventure, or
from whatever cause it might have come, Monsieur
d'Heurteleure and Monsieur d'Aiglieul disappeared
one day, no one knew whither. Time passed. The
searches were fruitless. Some mystery was hinted at.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1675">[Pg 1675]</span>
Madame d'Heurteleure wept. All sorts of singular
suspicions were afloat, which finally reached the court
where these two gentlemen were still remembered.
One day the double disappearance was mentioned in
the hearing of Monsieur d'Amercœur, who determined
to solve the enigma. He was empowered with
full authority to act and at once he set about it.</p>

<p>His first care was to assume a monastic frock, certain
with this attire to penetrate everywhere, through
half-opened doors as well as through the fissures of
conscience, and Dom Ricard helped him to the best of
his power. For a while his researches were without
result; but aided by the incognito of his costume and
his apparent calling, his inquiries were patient and
diverse. He hovered about the d'Heurteleure house,
scrutinized the people and the habits, studied the life.
He listened to and weighed all the still vivacious rumors.
In vain. He wished to see Madame d'Heurteleure.
He was told that she was ill. Every day he
passed the house; following the street which rises
around the sub-basement, he reached the front, pausing
sometimes to slake his thirst at the fountain. Returning,
as he descended the steps, he examined the
enormous foundations of stone and solid rock, longing
to apply his ear and listen to their mystery, for it
seemed to him that the flanks of the old castle contained
the fantom of the secret, which he had come to
evoke from silence before it passed into oblivion. At
last, discouraged, he was on the point of giving up.
He would have taken leave of Dom Ricard but for the
old monk's urgent advice to remain. The venerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1676">[Pg 1676]</span>
prior enjoyed the society of this sheep, so dissimilar
to the members of the flock which his wooden cross
conducted in the monotonous paths of the Order.</p>

<p>One day toward five o'clock in the afternoon, Monsieur
d'Amercœur went out by the old portal and
strolled amid the tall grasses of the avenue. The
moment was melancholy and grandiose; the trees
threw their shadows across the funereal path, the
lizards ran over the warm stones of the antique tombs
and in and out of their fissures. With one hand
Monsieur d'Amercœur held up the long monk's frock,
with the other he held the key to open the heart-shaped
lock of the medicinal garden, where he loved
to wander. He wished to visit it once more before
he went away, to hear once more the soles of his sandals
scraping over the gravel, while his frock brushed
the borders of boxwood. The symmetry of the plots
pleased him; their squares contained delicate plants
and curious flowers; little pools nourished aquatic
specimens which plunged their roots into the water,
flowered and mirrored their bloom. At the intersection
of the paths stood porcelain urns painted with
emblems and pharmaceutical designs, with serpents
twisted about the handles, and these urns contained
varieties rare and precious. Above the walls waved
the tops of the poplars; from the kitchen gardens off
to one side, separated by high green trellises, came
the sound of a rake, the striking of a spade against a
watering can, the little sound of shears clipping the
young shoots; in here all was silence; a flower bent,
flexible, under the weight of an insect, swallows darted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1677">[Pg 1677]</span>
about; dragon flies flitted across the greenish water;
heavy plants and delicate vines twined and intertwined.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Amercœur was going toward the door
of this odd little enclosure when, at the end of the
avenue, he saw approaching a woman dressed in
black. She walked slowly with faltering steps. By
some inner revelation he knew at once that this was
Madame d'Heurteleure. He slackened his own pace,
so as to meet her at the moment when he stopped before
the door. Arrived there, he put the key into the
lock. At the sound the lady started and hesitated.
He stooped as though trying to turn the key. She
wished to profit by this moment to pass; but found
herself face to face with him as he suddenly turned.
She stood with one hand pressing down her palpitating
heart. He saw a face pale and lovely, though
haggard from grief and insomnia, with troubled eyes,
half-parted lips. Then he entered quickly, closing the
door and leaving in the iron-heart of the lock the key.</p>

<p>The next day he was meditating in the little cloister
when a messenger came to tell him that a veiled lady
desired to speak with him. She was admitted. He
recognized Madame d'Heurteleure, and invited her to
be seated on a stone bench. The doves cooed softly
on the capitals of the quiet cloister, their murmurs
mingled with the sighs of the penitent. She sank on
her knees, and with bent head and hands folded in his
wide sleeves Monsieur d'Amercœur listened to her
dolorous confession. It was a horrible and tragic
story. Why relate it to him? Because her secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1678">[Pg 1678]</span>
seemed to have been laid bare. When she saw a monk
holding a key to open that heart-shaped lock, she felt
as though he meant to force open her conscience.
Their meeting seemed like a decree of fate, his gesture
a mysterious allusion to the deliverance of her
soul imprisoned in the horror of its silence.</p>

<p>Her marriage with Monsieur d'Heurteleure was
loveless. She esteemed, while she feared his noble
character, the hardness of which intimidated her confidence
and discouraged her tenderness. Years passed.
One winter Monsieur d'Aiglieul appeared and called
frequently. He was handsome and still young. She
yielded to his love. Then followed days of joy and
terror; a dread of discovery and an agony of remorse.
Monsieur d'Heurteleure seemed unaware of their perfidy,
though he grew suddenly old and another deep
line was added to those already furrowing his brow.
He was as usual often absent. One evening Madame
d'Heurteleure retired to her room about midnight.
She felt depressed. Monsieur d'Aiglieul had not appeared
and he seldom missed a day. As she was combing
her hair before a mirror she saw the door open,
and her husband entered. He was booted, but his
boots bore no trace of outdoor mire; his coat looked
dusty, a long spider web hung from his sleeve and in
his hand he held a key. Without speaking he went
directly to the wall of the chamber where a nail fastened
an ivory crucifix, which he tore off and broke
upon the floor, while in its place he suspended the
heavy rusty key. Madame d'Heurteleure gazed for
a moment without comprehending, then all at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1679">[Pg 1679]</span>
her hands clasped her heart, she gave a cry and fell
unconscious.</p>

<p>When she came to herself the whole affair was clear
to her. Her husband had allured Monsieur d'Aiglieul
into some trap. The old mansion in its invisible depths
contained dungeons, chambers of eternal oblivion. A
cry, his, vibrated still in her ears. It seemed to come
from below, deafened by the piled-up stone, piercing
the superposed arches, reaching her from those lips
forever separated by the thickness of the walls. She
tried to get out, the door was fastened, the windows
were padlocked, the domestics occupied another part
of the house and were beyond her call. The next day
Monsieur d'Heurteleure came to bring her food.
Each day he came. The spider's web still hung from
his dusty sleeve, his boots creaked on the tesselated
floor, the great line on his forehead deepened in a
pallor of sleepless misery. He went away silently and
to her tears and supplications he replied only by a
brief gesture, showing the key hung against the wall.</p>

<p>During those tragic days the wretched woman lived
with her eyes fixed on the horrible ex-voto, which
grew larger to her vision, became enormous. The
patches of rust looked like red blood. The house was
still as death. Toward evening a step was heard.
Monsieur d'Heurteleure again entered bearing a lamp
and a basket. His head had grown white, he did not
now so much as glance at the unhappy being who
groveled at his feet, but he never failed to stare greedily
at the key. Then at last Madame d'Heurteleure
understood the desire which gnawed, which was devouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1680">[Pg 1680]</span>
him—to see his rival in death, to gloat over
his vengeance, to feel of the corruption that had once
been flesh and blood, to take down that key he had
hung on the wall in place of the Sign of Pardon, the
ivory emblem of which he had shattered to substitute
an iron symbol of eternal rancor. But alas! vengeance
never is satisfied, always she craves for more; frenzied,
insatiable, she feeds on her own vehemence to the
very dregs of memory, until the end of life.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Heurteleure felt that she guessed his
morbid longing and that added to his torture. The
adamant of his pride was streaked with veins of
blood. One night when Madame d'Heurteleure slumbered,
stretched on her bed, she heard her door open
softly and saw her husband on the threshold. He
carried a lamp with the flame turned low, and walked
as lightly as a shadow without a sound, as though the
sombre somnambulism of his fixed idea had made of
him an imponderable fantom. He crossed the room,
reached up, took down the key and went out again.
There was a dead silence. A fly awakened by the
light buzzed for an instant and then ceased. The
door remained on the latch. Madame d'Heurteleure
bounded up. In her bare feet she slipped into the
hall. Her husband was going downstairs; she followed
him. At the ground floor he continued to descend;
the stairway plunged into gloom, but she could
hear along the subterranean corridors the steps which
preceded her. They were now in the ancient substructions
of the castle. The walls sweated, the ceilings
were vaulted. A last stairway twisted its spiral into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1681">[Pg 1681]</span>
the rock. At its base the light of the vanishing lamp
still glimmered on the slimy pavement. Bending forward,
Madame d'Heurteleure listened. A grating
sound reached her and the light disappeared. At the
foot of the stairs she found a circular chamber. An
opening in the wall revealed a shallow bay; she still
crept on, until, at the end of the passage, by feeling
her way, she recognized a door very slightly ajar.
She pushed it open. In a sort of square hole, vaulted
above and tiled below, Monsieur d'Heurteleure was
seated beside his little lamp. He was motionless, staring
with wide-open eyes. He looked at his wife without
seeing her. A nauseating odor came from the cell,
and beyond the shadow spread over the tiles lay a
fleshless hand already greenish in hue.</p>

<p>Madame d'Heurteleure did not scream. Should
she waken the wretched somnambulist, whose frenzied
sleep had drawn him to this tragic dungeon? Was
she capable of inflicting this degrading shock upon his
pride? No. The vengeance of the outrage was just.
She felt pity for those wild eyes, which stared at her
without seeing her, for the tortured visage, for the
hair blanched by such poignant anguish, and it seemed
to her best to protect the secret of this nocturnal adventure
that he might never discover his self-betrayal.
He must, she deemed, be allowed to satisfy his terrible
craving in the eternal silence of the tomb, without
ever knowing whose unseen hand walled him in face
to face with his sacrilege.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Heurteleure still gazed blankly at her.
Very calmly she knelt and clasped the greenish palm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1682">[Pg 1682]</span>
which stretched its fleshless fingers over the tiles, and
then from the outside she closed the door. Walking
away on tiptoe, she slid the bolt of the vault which
closed the passage. She ascended the spiral stairs, the
subterranean steps, the stairways of the upper house,
and on the rusty nail of her chamber wall she suspended
the tragic key, which balanced itself an instant,
then hung motionless to mark an eternal hour.</p>

<p>The doves passed to and fro as they flew below the
arches of the little cloister. The hour rang out simultaneously
from all the belfries in the city. The miserable
woman sobbed and offered Monsieur d'Amercœur
the great key, letting it fall at his feet. He picked it
up; it was heavy and the patches of rust were red like
blood. He walked away. Madame d'Heurteleure,
still kneeling, supplicated wildly with her hands joined
convulsively. He descended toward the little garden,
which embalmed the centre of the cloister with its
fragrant flowers which grew in beds equally divided
by boxwood. Great roses engarlanded the well with
its stone circle; their thorns clung to the monkish
frock as he bent over to drink; the water spurted out.
A tall, golden sunflower mirrored its honey-laden
monstrance. A dove cooed faintly, and Monsieur
d'Amercœur, returning to his still prostrate penitent,
murmured in her ear the words of an absolution
which, if it lost nothing in heaven, gave at least on
earth peace to a tortured soul.</p>

<p><em>Alphonse Allais, who has left an original
successor in Georges Courteline, was the great
joker of Paris who died in 1905, at fifty years

crisp, up-to-date style, in the language of the
reporter and of the boulevards. Like most of
the modern French literary aspirants, Allais
made his début in the Paris journals. He
wrote humorous, fantastic monologues full of
life, and what the French call "verve," which is
a kind of sprightly enthusiasm tempered by an
original personality. He has written, besides

<p>I stepped upon the platform at Baisenmoyen-Cert
station, where my friend Lenfileur awaited
me with his carriage.</p>

<p>While on the train I suddenly recollected something
that required immediate attention at Paris. Upon my
arrival at Baisenmoyen-Cert, I went to the telegraph
office to send back a message.</p>

<p>This station differed from others of its class because
of the total lack of writing materials.</p>

<p>After a prolonged exploration, I finally succeeded
in capturing a rusty pen, dipping it in some colorless,
slimy fluid. With heroic effort I succeeded in daubing
down the few words of my telegram. A decidedly
unprepossessing woman grudgingly took the despatch,
counted it, and named the rate, which I immediately
paid.</p>

<p>With the relieved conscience of having fulfilled a
duty, I was about to walk out when my attention was
attracted by a young lady at one of the tables manipulating
a Morse key. With slight hauteur she turned
her back toward me.</p>

<p>Was she young? Probably. She certainly was red-haired.
Was she pretty? Why not? Her simple
black dress advantageously displayed a round, agreeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1686">[Pg 1686]</span>
form; her luxuriant hair was arranged so as to
reveal a few ringlets and a splendid white neck. And
suddenly a mad, inexplicable desire to plant a kiss
upon those golden ringlets seized me. In the expectation
that the young lady would turn round,
I stopped and asked the elderly woman a few questions
anent telegraph affairs. Her replies were not
at all friendly.</p>

<p>The other woman, however, did not stir.</p>

<p>Whoever supposes that I did not go to the telegraph
office the next morning does not know me.</p>

<p>The pretty, red-haired one was alone this time.</p>

<p>Now she was compelled to show her face, and,
<em>Sapristi!</em> I could not complain.</p>

<p>I purchased some telegraph stamps, wrote several
messages, asked a number of nonsensical questions,
and played the part of a chump with amazing
fidelity.</p>

<p>She responded calmly, prudently, in the manner of
a clever, self-possessed, and polite little woman.</p>

<p>And I came daily, sometimes twice a day, for I
knew when she would be alone.</p>

<p>To give my calls a reasonable appearance I wrote
innumerable letters to friends and telegraphed to an
army of bare acquaintances a lot of impossible stuff.
So that it was rumored in Paris that I had suddenly
become deranged.</p>

<p>Every day I say to myself: "To-day, my boy, you
must make a declaration." But her cold manner suppressed
upon my lips the words: "Mademoiselle, I love
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1687">[Pg 1687]</span></p>

<p>I invariably confined myself to stammering:</p>

<p>"Be kind enough to give me a three-sou stamp."</p>

<p>The situation gradually became unbearable.</p>

<p>As the day for my return approached, I resolved to
burn my ships behind me and to venture all to win
everything.</p>

<p>I walked into the office and wrote the following
message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Coquelin, Cadet,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> 17 Boulevard Haussmann, Paris:
I am madly in love with the little red-haired telegraph
operator at Baisenmoyen-Cert."</p>
</div>

<p>I tremblingly handed her the telegram.</p>

<p>I expected at least, that her beautiful white complexion
would effulge.</p>

<p>But no!</p>

<p>Not a muscle relaxed! In the calmest manner in the
world she said: "Fifty-nine centimes, please."</p>

<p>Thoroughly nonplused by this queenly serenity, I
fumbled about in my pockets for the coin.</p>

<p>But I could not find a sou. From my pocket-book I
took a thousand-franc note and gave it her.</p>

<p>She took the bank-note and scrutinized it carefully.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1688">[Pg 1688]</span></p>
<p>The examination terminated favorably, for her
